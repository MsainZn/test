Computer simulation tool for rhinoplasty planning,Ozkul T.; Ozkul M.H.,2004,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2003.10.006,"Rhinoplasty is a collection of surgical procedures performed on nose for the purpose of correcting functional and shape deformities. Nose is a facial feature which naturally draws attention during everyday contact. Any operation performed on nose has to blend well with the other facial features of the face. For this reason rhinoplasty is a type of surgery which requires artistic skills from surgeon as well as surgical skills. In this paper we present an artistic simulation tool which manipulates the shape of the nose on the bases of rhinoplasty procedures to be used during the surgery. Unlike other artistic simulation tools which can modify shape with no constraints, this tool simulates the effect of individual operations. Simulation tool can be valuable only if it predicts the outcome of the surgery with accuracy. Ultimately the outcome of the simulation depends largely on the experience of the surgeon. This is also the case with the tool presented in this study, so with experience the tool can be useful for predicting outcome more and more accurately. In this paper, the mechanical model of the nose and tools used for simulation are discussed. The simulation results are compared with actual rhinoplasty results to see the fidelity of the approach. A flowchart of the decision process and how rhinoplastic simulation together with the ideal nose data can be used to aid actual rhinoplastic surgery is given at the end. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing methods often rely on 3D facial data, which are not always available in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for 3D-guided face manipulation of 2D images to predict post-operative outcomes. Our approach reconstructs a 3D face model from a single 2D image, simulates surgical procedures on the 3D model, and then generates a manipulated 2D image reflecting the predicted post-operative appearance. The framework integrates a parametric 3D morphable model with a deep learning-based image synthesis network, ensuring both geometric accuracy and photorealistic rendering. Extensive experiments on clinical datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in predicting post-operative facial changes compared to state-of-the-art techniques, providing a valuable tool for surgical planning and patient consultation."

However, the current in vitro models used to study osteointegration lack the complexity of human bone tissue, limiting their predictive value. Here, we present an advanced human bone tissue culture model that mimics the in vivo environment for the assessment of implant osteointegration. Human trabecular bone explants were cultured under dynamic conditions in a perfusion bioreactor system, maintaining cell viability and bone matrix integrity over 28 days. Titanium implant discs were inserted into the bone explants, and osteointegration was evaluated by histological, biochemical, and mechanical analyses. Our model demonstrated active bone remodeling and new bone formation at the bone-implant interface, closely resembling physiological osteointegration processes. This advanced in vitro model provides a valuable platform for preclinical testing of implant materials and surface modifications, potentially reducing the need for animal experiments and accelerating implant development."
Analysis of In Vivo Skin Anisotropy Using Elastic Wave Measurements and Bayesian Modelling,Nagle M.; Price S.; Trotta A.; Destrade M.; Fop M.; Ní Annaidh A.,2023,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,Springer,"Skin anisotropy is a key biomechanical property that influences the mechanical response of skin to external forces.

However, the current design methods are mainly based on the surgeon’s experience, which is subjective and lacks quantitative evaluation. This study proposes a novel computer-aided design (CAD) method for flap design based on morphological flattening and three-dimensional (3D) wound analysis.

Improved non-local self-similarity measures for effective speckle noise reduction in ultrasound images,Mei F.; Zhang D.; Yang Y.,2020,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,"Speckle noise is an inherent granular noise that degrades the quality of ultrasound images and affects the performance of subsequent image processing tasks. Non-local means (NLM) filtering is a popular technique for speckle noise reduction due to its ability to preserve image details by exploiting the redundancy of similar patches in the image.

Self-setting bioactive calcium-magnesium phosphate cement with high strength and degradability for bone regeneration,Wu F.; Wei J.; Guo H.; Chen F.; Hong H.; Liu C.,2008,Acta Biomaterialia,Elsevier BV,"Calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) have been widely used as bone substitutes due to their excellent biocompatibility and osteoconductivity. However, their clinical applications are limited by their low mechanical strength and slow degradation rate. In this study, a novel self-setting bioactive calcium-magnesium phosphate cement (CMPC) was developed by partially substituting calcium with magnesium in the cement composition. The CMPC exhibited significantly improved compressive strength and enhanced degradability compared to conventional CPCs. In vitro bioactivity tests demonstrated the formation of bone-like apatite on the CMPC surface after immersion in simulated body fluid. Furthermore, in vivo implantation in rabbit femoral defects showed that the CMPC promoted new bone formation and was gradually resorbed, indicating its potential as a promising bone graft material for bone regeneration applications."

Our method combines statistical analysis with pseudophysical simulation techniques to produce hair strands that respond naturally to user interactions and environmental forces. The approach allows for efficient computation suitable for real-time applications, providing artists and users with intuitive control over hairstyle design and animation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in generating diverse and visually plausible hairstyles with interactive performance."
The effect of fixture neck design in a realistic model of dental implant: A finite element approach,Necchi S.; Migliavacca F.; Gastaldi D.; Pizzagalli M.; Del Fabbro M.; Weinstein R.; Pietrabissa R.; Dubini G.,2003,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,,"The effect of fixture neck design on the stress distribution in a dental implant and the surrounding bone was investigated using a three-dimensional finite element model. Three different fixture neck designs were analyzed under vertical and oblique loading conditions to simulate masticatory forces. The results showed that the design of the fixture neck significantly influenced the stress distribution in both the implant and the bone. A smooth transition in the fixture neck reduced stress concentration, potentially improving the longevity of the implant. These findings suggest that careful consideration of fixture neck design is crucial in dental implantology to minimize bone resorption and implant failure."
