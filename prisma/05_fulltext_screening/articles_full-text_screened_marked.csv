Chemical-physical behavior of Hydroxyapatite: A modeling approach,Guerfi Z.; Kribaa O.K.; Djouama H.,2024,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2023.106229,"Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is a ceramic composed of calcium phosphate, frequently employed as a bone substitute material due to its biocompatibility and bioactivity. Over the past century, there has been substantial attention in fields such as orthopedics and plastic surgery. Remarkably, synthetic HAp exhibits properties akin to those found in natural bone and teeth. Computational theoretical chemistry focuses on numerically computing molecular electronic structures and interactions. As chemistry education evolves, it's imperative to acknowledge the increasing significance of computational tools in research. Density Functional Theory (DFT) stands out as the most widely adopted method in contemporary computational chemistry. In this study, we synthesized Hydroxyapatite (HAp) via the double decomposition method using synthetic sources. The synthesized materials underwent thorough characterization, including X-ray Diffraction (XRD), UV–visible spectroscopy, and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy under various conditions. Additionally, we performed quantum mechanical computations on the HAp molecule using density functional theory. Our results were then compared with experimental data. Our experimental findings highlight the successful synthesis of HAp, particularly under specific temperature conditions. Moreover, the quantum chemistry calculations exhibited excellent agreement with the experimental results, especially in terms of spectroscopic characterizations. © 2023",TRUE,"Focuses on the chemical and physical traits of hydroxyapatite, not on automatic prediction or assessment of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery."

"Vascular anastomoses, hemodynamics and hemorheology: Some general thoughts and open questions",Nemeth N.,2022,Series on Biomechanics,10.7546/SB.09.2022,"Safe and well-functioning vascular anastomoses are essential in the everyday practice of vascular surgery, heart surgery, transplantation surgery as well as in reconstructive procedures, including microsurgical approaches. Regeneration of artificial vascular anastomoses, especially the maturation of fistulas and venous grafts, is strongly influenced by the hemodynamic forces driven by the flow characteristics as well. Exploring the hemorheological and hemodynamic conditions thus is inevitable to understand better the physiology and pathophysiology of the regeneration of vascular anastomoses and graft implantations, as well as in other vascular surgical interventions. In this paper main aspects and findings of experimental surgical and microsurgical models are summarized, studying artificial arterio-venous fistulas, porto-caval shunts, and various grafts using in vivo measurements, hemorheological and hemodynamic investigations, as well as special 3D flow simulation studies on ex vivo vascular segments. © 2022, Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite.

An Advanced Human Bone Tissue Culture Model for the Assessment of Implant Osteointegration In Vitro,Maglio M.; Fini M.; Sartori M.; Codispoti G.; Borsari V.; Dallari D.; Ambretti S.; Rocchi M.; Tschon M.,2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,10.3390/ijms25105322,"In the field of biomaterials for prosthetic reconstructive surgery, there is the lack of advanced innovative methods to investigate the potentialities of smart biomaterials before in vivo tests. Despite the complex osteointegration process being difficult to recreate in vitro, this study proposes an advanced in vitro tissue culture model of osteointegration using human bone. Cubic samples of trabecular bone were harvested, as waste material, from hip arthroplasty; inner cylindrical defects were created and assigned to the following groups: (1) empty defects (CTRneg); (2) defects implanted with a cytotoxic copper pin (CTRpos); (3) defects implanted with standard titanium pins (Ti). Tissues were dynamically cultured in mini rotating bioreactors and assessed weekly for viability and sterility. After 8 weeks, immunoenzymatic, microtomographic, histological, and histomorphometric analyses were performed. The model was able to simulate the effects of implantation of the materials, showing a drop in viability in CTR+, while Ti appears to have a trophic effect on bone. MicroCT and a histological analysis supported the results, with signs of matrix and bone deposition at the Ti implant site. Data suggest the reliability of the tested model in recreating the osteointegration process in vitro with the aim of reducing and refining in vivo preclinical models. © 2024 by the authors.",FALSE,
SERV-CT: A disparity dataset from cone-beam CT for validation of endoscopic 3D reconstruction,Edwards P.J.E.; Psychogyios D.; Speidel S.; Maier-Hein L.; Stoyanov D.,2022,Medical Image Analysis,10.1016/j.media.2021.102302,"In computer vision, reference datasets from simulation and real outdoor scenes have been highly successful in promoting algorithmic development in stereo reconstruction. Endoscopic stereo reconstruction for surgical scenes gives rise to specific problems, including the lack of clear corner features, highly specular surface properties and the presence of blood and smoke. These issues present difficulties for both stereo reconstruction itself and also for standardised dataset production. Previous datasets have been produced using computed tomography (CT) or structured light reconstruction on phantom or ex vivo models. We present a stereo-endoscopic reconstruction validation dataset based on cone-beam CT (SERV-CT). Two ex vivo small porcine full torso cadavers were placed within the view of the endoscope with both the endoscope and target anatomy visible in the CT scan. Subsequent orientation of the endoscope was manually aligned to match the stereoscopic view and benchmark disparities, depths and occlusions are calculated. The requirement of a CT scan limited the number of stereo pairs to 8 from each ex vivo sample. For the second sample an RGB surface was acquired to aid alignment of smooth, featureless surfaces. Repeated manual alignments showed an RMS disparity accuracy of around 2 pixels and a depth accuracy of about 2 mm. A simplified reference dataset is provided consisting of endoscope image pairs with corresponding calibration, disparities, depths and occlusions covering the majority of the endoscopic image and a range of tissue types, including smooth specular surfaces, as well as significant variation of depth. We assessed the performance of various stereo algorithms from online available repositories. There is a significant variation between algorithms, highlighting some of the challenges of surgical endoscopic images. The SERV-CT dataset provides an easy to use stereoscopic validation for surgical applications with smooth reference disparities and depths covering the majority of the endoscopic image.

A method for assessing guide layout and error on implant accuracy,Xu L.; Tian X.; Wu J.,2024,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108824,"Functional and esthetic results require accurate implant placement. We aimed to develop a predictive method for assessing guide layout and error on implant accuracy. A mathematical model for position error analysis was constructed based on triangular mesh data. This model examines the relationship between the spatial shifts of multiple surfaces and the spatial shifts of specific points. It involves encasing these surfaces in a cuboid bounding box and expressing them in a local coordinate system. The influence of positioning surface error and layout of surgical guide were researched with a simulation test. The result shows that error in the implant site position is directly related to the error in the guide locating surface under the same layout. When the guide locating surface layout varies, as the length, width, and height of the minimum cuboid envelope increase, the maximum deviation in the implant site position decreases. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Centers on implant placement accuracy and doesn't cover automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results, so it doesn't fit the review's focus on assessing aesthetics in plastic and cancer-related surgeries."

3D-Guided Face Manipulation of 2D Images for the Prediction of Post-Operative Outcome after Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery,Andlauer R.; Wachter A.; Schaufelberger M.; Weichel F.; Kuhle R.; Freudlsperger C.; Nahm W.,2021,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2021.3096081,"Cranio-maxillofacial surgery often alters the aesthetics of the face which can be a heavy burden for patients to decide whether or not to undergo surgery. Today, physicians can predict the post-operative face using surgery planning tools to support the patient's decision-making. While these planning tools allow a simulation of the post-operative face, the facial texture must usually be captured by another 3D texture scan and subsequently mapped on the simulated face. This approach often results in face predictions that do not appear realistic or lively looking and are therefore ill-suited to guide the patient's decision-making. Instead, we propose a method using a generative adversarial network to modify a facial image according to a 3D soft-tissue estimation of the post-operative face. To circumvent the lack of available data pairs between pre- and post-operative measurements we propose a semi-supervised training strategy using cycle losses that only requires paired open-source data of images and 3D surfaces of the face's shape. After training on 'in-the-wild' images we show that our model can realistically manipulate local regions of a face in a 2D image based on a modified 3D shape. We then test our model on four clinical examples where we predict the post-operative face according to a 3D soft-tissue prediction of surgery outcome, which was simulated by a surgery planning tool. As a result, we aim to demonstrate the potential of our approach to predict realistic post-operative images of faces without the need of paired clinical data, physical models, or 3D texture scans. © 2021 IEEE.",FALSE,

Manufacturing of customized implants for orbital fractures using 3D printing,A M.; Mohan A A.; Reddy M H.,2021,Bioprinting,10.1016/j.bprint.2020.e00118,"An orbital fracture is a traumatic injury to the bone in the eye socket. These fractures modify the orbital bone dimensions and the functioning of the intraorbital contents. In this study, a surgical method that includes positioning, aligning and fixing implants to restore orbital fractures was adapted. Notably, it is difficult to achieve an original three-dimensional orbital shape through the process of forming and cutting implants; however, this problem was solved by creating customized implants using computed tomography (CT) images of the patient. The objective of this work is to reconstruct the damaged orbital floor defects by means of a 3D printed implant and restore the orbital floor to its original shape. A case study of an orbital fracture has been included in this study. CT images were used to create a computer-aided design (CAD) model of orbital floor implants, which were designed to maintain orbital floor symmetry from right to left and vice versa. Furthermore, the designed implants were manufactured through a material extrusion process with biocompatible material. The application of the material extrusion process with biocompatible material resulted in the fabrication of implants at a minimal cost.

A novel three dimensional-printed biomechanically evaluated patient-specific sacral implant in spinopelvic reconstruction after total en bloc sacrectomy,Lv Z.; Li J.; Yang Z.; Li X.; Yang Q.; Li Z.,2023,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2023.1153801,"Background: Reconstruction after a total sacrectomy is a challenge due to the special anatomical and biomechanical factors. Conventional techniques of spinal-pelvic reconstruction do not reconstruct satisfactorily. We describe a novel three-dimensional-printed patient-specific sacral implant in spinopelvic reconstruction after total en bloc sacrectomy. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study including 12 patients with primary malignant sacral tumors, including 5 men and 7 women with a mean age of 58.25 years (range 20–66 years), undergoing total en bloc sacrectomy with 3D printed implant reconstruction from 2016 to 2021. There were 7 cases of chordoma, 3 cases of osteosarcoma, 1 case of chondrosarcoma and 1 case of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. We use CAD technology to determine surgical resection boundaries, design cutting guides, and individualized prostheses, and perform surgical simulations before surgery. The implant design was biomechanically evaluated by finite element analysis. Operative data, oncological and functional outcomes, complications, and implant osseointegration status of 12 consecutive patients were reviewed. Results: The implants were implanted successfully in 12 cases without death or severe complications during the perioperative period. Resection margins were wide in 11 patients and marginal in one patient. The average blood loss was 3875 mL (range, 2000–5,000 mL). The average surgical time was 520 min (range, 380–735 min). The mean follow-up was 38.5 months. Nine patients were alive with no evidence of disease, two patients died due to pulmonary metastases, and one patient survived with disease due to local recurrence. Overall survival was 83.33% at 24 months. The Mean VAS was 1.5 (range, 0–2). The mean MSTS score was 21 (range, 17–24). Wound complications occurred in 2 cases. A deep infection occurred in one patient and the implant was removed. No implant mechanical failure was identified. Satisfactory osseointegration was found in all patients, with a mean fusion time of 5 months (range 3–6 months). Conclusion: The 3D-printed custom sacral prosthesis has been effective in reconstructing spinal-pelvic stability after total en bloc sacrectomy with satisfactory clinical outcomes, excellent osseointegration, and excellent durability.

Incisions and wounds are introduced by element removal and the sutures are discretely modeled by applying linear constraint relations pairwise to groups of nodes. Two numerical examples utilize the closing of an elliptical wound to study the influence of the number of sutures and their location, and two test cases use the Z-plasty transposition flap technique to investigate the versatility of the proposed method and for comparison with state-of-the-art results. The results indicate that the presented method is able to recreate literature results to an acceptable level of accuracy. Further, the method proves versatile due to the ability to freely introduce incisions and wounds onto the fixed grid modeling domain without remeshing. Lastly, the two main advantages of the discrete suture representation are the ability to capture local stress concentrations near the sutures and the full freedom in placing the sutures. © 2024 The Author(s)",FALSE,

The synthetic implants are used for the reconstructive surgery of POP, but severe complications associated with their use have been reported, mainly related to their mechanical properties (e.g., implant stiffness) and microstructure. In this study, we mimicked a transvaginal reconstructive surgery to repair the apical ligaments (uterosacral ligaments (USLs) and cardinal ligaments (CLs)), by modeling, their impairment (90% and 50%) and/or total rupture. The implants to reinforce/replace these ligaments were built based on literature specifications and their mechanical properties were obtained through uniaxial tensile tests. The main aim of this study was to simulate the effect of mesh anchoring technique (simple stich and continuous stitch), and compare the displacement magnitude of the pelvic tissues, during Valsalva maneuver. The absence/presence of the synthetic implant was simulated when total rupture of the CLs and USLs occurs, causing a variation of the vaginal displacement (9% for the CLs and 27% for the USLs). Additionally, the simulations showed that there was a variation of the supero-inferior displacement of the vaginal wall between different anchoring techniques (simple stich and continuous stitch) being approximately of 10% for the simulation USLs and CLs implant. The computational simulation was able to mimic the biomechanical behavior of the USLs and CLs, in response to different anchoring techniques, which can be help improving the outcomes of the prolapse surgery. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,
Biomechanical comparison of locking and non-locking patient-specific mandibular reconstruction plate using finite element analysis,Zhong S.; Shi Q.; Sun Y.; Yang S.; Van Dessel J.; Gu Y.; Chen X.; Lübbers H.-T.; Politis C.,2021,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104849,"Patient-specific mandibular reconstruction plate (PSMRP), as one of the patient-specific implants (PSIs), offers a host of benefits to mandibular reconstruction. Due to the limitation of fabricating screw hole threads in the PSMRP, 3D printed PSMRP is applied to the non-locking system directly in the mandibular reconstruction with bone graft regardless of the locking system. Since the conventional manual-bending reconstruction plate (CMBRP) provides better fixation in the locking system, it needs to be validated whether the locking PSMRP performs better than the non-locking PSMRP in the patient-specific mandibular reconstruction. Thereupon, the purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical behavior between the locking and non-locking PSMRP. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to conduct the biomechanical comparison between the locking PSMRP and non-locking PSMRP by simulating the momentary incisal clenching through static structural analysis. Mandible was reconstructed through the virtual surgical planning, and subsequently a 3D model of mandibular reconstruction assembly, including reconstructed mandible, PSMRP, and fixation screws, was generated and meshed for the following FEA simulations. In the form of equivalent von Mises stress, equivalent elastic strain, and total deformation, the locking PSMRP demonstrated its higher strengths of preferable safety, desirable flexibility, and anticipated stability compared with the non-locking PSMRP, indicated by much lower maximum stress, lower maximum strain and equivalent displacement. Locking PSMRP/screw system provides a better fixation effect to the patient-specific mandibular reconstruction than the non-locking one as a result of its productive fixation nature.

Optimization of grinding parameters in robotic-assisted preparation of cracked teeth based on fracture mechanics: FEA and experiment,Sun J.; Jiang J.; Ma B.; Zhang Y.; Pan J.; Qiao D.,2025,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108485,"Background and Objectives: If left untreated, cracked teeth can lead to tooth loss, of which the incidence is 70%. Dental preparation is an effective treatment, but it is difficult to meet the clinical requirements when traditionally prepared by dentists. Grinding-based tooth preparation robot (TPR) shows promise for clinical applications to assist dentists. However, current TPR has problems with chipping and crack extension when preparing real teeth. Methods: We propose a grinding parameter optimization strategy to solve this problem, specifically including preparation depth and direction. Among them, surface morphology observation technology and thermal-mechanical coupling simulation technology are used. Through theoretical modeling, computer simulation techniques and surface morphology experimental studies, different motion parameters are compared and analyzed to derive the optimal preparation parameters. Results: One of our contributions is to control the preparation depth based on the different material removal methods, and the brittle removal methods and grinding heat during the preparation process were reduced. Another contribution is to derive the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip for different preparation directions based on multi-grit and thermal-mechanical coupling finite element model for different preparation stages. The preparation direction was directed and crack extension was minimized. Finally, the experimental system of the TPR was constructed. Based on the proposed morphology and preparation direction optimization method, the material removal method during the preparation process can be controlled in plastic removal. Crack extension was also reduced based on different stages of optimized preparation directions. Based on the guided strategy, the TPR can provide safe assisted dentists.

Subjective scar assessment scales in orthopaedic surgery and determinants of patient satisfaction: a systematic review of the literature,"Lastoria, Diego A Abelleyra and Benny, Clerin K and Hing, Caroline B",2023,Chinese Journal of Traumatology,Elsevier,"Background: Scars are an inevitable consequence of surgery and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Subjective scar assessment scales are commonly used in orthopaedic surgery to evaluate scar appearance and patient satisfaction. This systematic review aims to summarize the available subjective scar assessment scales used in orthopaedic surgery and identify determinants of patient satisfaction with surgical scars.  Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in multiple databases to identify studies that utilized subjective scar assessment scales in orthopaedic surgery and reported on factors influencing patient satisfaction. Data on the types of scales used, their psychometric properties, and determinants of satisfaction were extracted and analyzed.  Results: Several subjective scar assessment scales were identified, including the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), and others. These scales vary in their focus on scar characteristics such as color, texture, and thickness, as well as patient-reported outcomes. Determinants of patient satisfaction included scar visibility, location, symptoms (e.g., pain, itching), and psychological impact. The POSAS was frequently used and demonstrated good reliability and validity.  Conclusions: Subjective scar assessment scales are valuable tools in orthopaedic surgery for evaluating scar outcomes and patient satisfaction.

Plastic hexahedral FEM for surgical simulation,Gao R.; Peters J.,2022,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-022-02742-9,"Purpose: Soft-tissue manipulations, such as collecting, stretching or tearing tissue, are a common component of surgery. When too much force is applied, these manipulations result in a residual plastic deformation that surgeons should be aware of and that should be modeled by surgical simulation. Methods: Many tissues, vessels and organs can be modeled as offsets of curved simple shapes with primary directions, e.g., radial and axial for cylinders yield a rectangular mesh whose normal offset naturally yields a hexahedral mesh that can serve as a thick shell. Other organs are easy to embed into and deform following a hex mesh. We extend existing code for the volumetric finite element method (FEM) to model tissue plasticity as hexahedral thick shells or embedded organs. Specifically, the work extends the open source Simulation Open Framework Architecture and its newest hyperelastic deformation addition, Caribou, with focus on surgical simulation. The extension factors deformation gradients into (corotational or hyperelastic) elastic factors and plastic factors and enforces volume preservation. Limits on per-element twist, twist torque, material hardening and bounds on plasticity where elements invert avoid the need for re-meshing. Results: Our hexahedral FEM avoids the biased outcomes of asymmetric coarsely-partitioned tetrahedral FEM. Caribou’s hyperelastic FEM is extended to hex-FEM stretching plasticity. Our high-order accurate blended-vertex deformation enables coarse hex meshes to model large plastic rotational and stretch deformations without re-meshing. We compare a vertex-blended to a cell-centered piecewise constant approach; contrast plasticity based on corotational FEM and hyperelastic FEM; and test the computation under mesh refinement. The volume is preserved also for large deformations.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary care craniofacial center. Patients: Thirty patients with unilateral cleft lip nasal deformity who underwent primary nasal correction at the time of lip repair. Intervention: Primary nasal correction performed concurrently with cleft lip repair. Main Outcome Measures: 3D nasal surface imaging was performed preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively. Nasal symmetry was assessed by comparing nasal surface area, nasal projection, and nostril dimensions between the cleft and noncleft sides. Results: At 1 year postoperatively, significant improvement in nasal symmetry was observed. The nasal surface area difference between the cleft and noncleft sides decreased from 15.2% preoperatively to 5.8% postoperatively (p < 0.001). Nasal projection and nostril dimensions also showed significant improvement, with no statistically significant difference between sides at 1 year. Conclusions: Primary nasal correction at the time of unilateral cleft lip repair results in significant improvement in nasal symmetry as objectively measured by 3D imaging.

Additively manufactured polyethylene terephthalate scaffolds for scapholunate interosseous ligament reconstruction,Gomez-Cerezo M.N.; Perevoshchikova N.; Ruan R.; Moerman K.M.; Bindra R.; Lloyd D.G.; Zheng M.H.; Saxby D.J.; Vaquette C.,2023,Biomaterials Advances,10.1016/j.bioadv.2023.213397,"The regeneration of the ruptured scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) represents a clinical challenge. Here, we propose the use of a Bone-Ligament-Bone (BLB) 3D-printed polyethylene terephthalate (PET) scaffold for achieving mechanical stabilisation of the scaphoid and lunate following SLIL rupture. The BLB scaffold featured two bone compartments bridged by aligned fibres (ligament compartment) mimicking the architecture of the native tissue. The scaffold presented tensile stiffness in the range of 260 ± 38 N/mm and ultimate load of 113 ± 13 N, which would support physiological loading. A finite element analysis (FEA), using inverse finite element analysis (iFEA) for material property identification, showed an adequate fit between simulation and experimental data. The scaffold was then biofunctionalized using two different methods: injected with a Gelatin Methacryloyl solution containing human mesenchymal stem cell spheroids (hMSC) or seeded with tendon-derived stem cells (TDSC) and placed in a bioreactor to undergo cyclic deformation. The first approach demonstrated high cell viability, as cells migrated out of the spheroid and colonised the interstitial space of the scaffold. These cells adopted an elongated morphology suggesting the internal architecture of the scaffold exerted topographical guidance. The second method demonstrated the high resilience of the scaffold to cyclic deformation and the secretion of a fibroblastic related protein was enhanced by the mechanical stimulation. This process promoted the expression of relevant proteins, such as Tenomodulin (TNMD), indicating mechanical stimulation may enhance cell differentiation and be useful prior to surgical implantation. In conclusion, the PET scaffold presented several promising characteristics for the immediate mechanical stabilisation of disassociated scaphoid and lunate and, in the longer-term, the regeneration of the ruptured SLIL. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",FALSE,
Temperature Field Prediction of Variable Bone Milling Conditions Based on Thermal-Parameter Calibration and Finite-Element Simulation,Zhou Z.; Hu J.; Dai Y.; Zhang J.; Jiang Z.,2025,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,10.1109/TIM.2025.3554280,"Bone milling is a common surgical procedure widely used in dental, orthopedic, and plastic surgeries. Bone has low thermal conductivity and high specific heat. As a result, significant heat generated during bone milling tends to accumulate in the milling area, often leading to thermal necrosis. Currently, there are no suitable sensors available to monitor the temperature during bone milling, which forces surgeons to rely on their personal experience to determine if the temperature is too high. This article presented a temperature field prediction model for robot-assisted bone milling using finite-element techniques. This model can predict the temperature distribution under various milling conditions, providing a valuable reference for surgeons. In developing this model, the thermal parameters of the cortical bone and the convective heat transfer coefficient of the environment were unknown. In order to determine these parameters, a heat conduction experiment based on a point heat source was designed. The identified parameters were then used to build the temperature prediction model. Five sets of dry milling experiments with different milling angles and depths and one set of experiments with irrigation fluid added were performed using a 4-DOF robot to verify the model.

The objective of this study is to establish a predictive computational model for the volumetric growth of pulmonary arterial (PA) tissue following complex cardiovascular patch reconstructive surgeries for congenital heart disease patients. For the first time in the literature, the growth mechanics and performance of artificial cardiovascular patches in contact with the growing PA tissue domain is established. An elastic-growing material model was developed in the open source FEBio software suite to first examine the surgical patch reconstruction process for an idealized main PA anatomy as a benchmark model and then for the patient-specific PA of a newborn. Following patch reconstruction, high levels of stress and strain are compensated by growth on the arterial tissue. As this growth progresses, the arterial tissue is predicted to stiffen to limit elastic deformations. We simulated this arterial growth up to the age of 18 years, when somatic growth plateaus. Our research findings show that the non-growing patch material remains in a low strain state throughout the simulation timeline, while experiencing high stress hot-spots. Arterial tissue growth along the surgical stitch lines is triggered mainly due to PA geometry and blood pressure, rather than due to material property differences in the artificial and native tissue. Thus, non-uniform growth patterns are observed along the arterial tissue proximal to the sutured boundaries. This computational approach is effective for the pre-surgical planning of complex patch surgeries to quantify the unbalanced growth of native arteries and artificial non-growing materials to develop optimal patch biomechanics for improved postoperative outcomes. © 2021",TRUE,Focuses on computational modeling for cardiovascular surgeries and doesn’t cover automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgeries.

Due to the complexity of the craniomaxillofacial (CMF) anatomy, orthognathic surgery requires precise surgical planning, which involves predicting postoperative changes in facial appearance. To this end, most conventional methods involve simulation with biomechanical modeling methods, which are labor intensive and computationally expensive. Here we introduce a learning-based framework to speed up the simulation of postoperative facial appearances. Specifically, we introduce a facial shape change prediction network (FSC-Net) to learn the nonlinear mapping from bony shape changes to facial shape changes. FSC-Net is a point transform network weakly-supervised by paired preoperative and postoperative data without point-wise correspondence. In FSC-Net, a distance-guided shape loss places more emphasis on the jaw region. A local point constraint loss restricts point displacements to preserve the topology and smoothness of the surface mesh after point transformation. Evaluation results indicate that FSC-Net achieves 15× speedup with accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art (SOTA) finite-element modeling (FEM) method.",FALSE,

The proposed sensor is designed to fully decouple the output response for normal, shear and angular forces. The proposed sensor is fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques and utilizes Neodymium magnets embedded in an elastomer over Hall sensors such that their displacement produces a voltage change that can be used to calculate the applied force. The initial spacing between the magnets and the Hall sensors is optimized to achieve a large displacement range using finite element method (FEM) simulations.

The purpose of this study was to test the biocompatibility of the SM with human limbus–derived epithelial cells with regard to their physical and biological properties. Methods: Different physical properties of SM were tested ex vivo by simulation on human corneas. In vitro, primary limbal epithelial cells from limbal explants were used to test biological properties such as cell migration, proliferation, metabolic activity, and limbal epithelial cell markers on the SM, hAM, and freeze-dried amniotic membrane (FDAM). Results: The surgical handleability of the SM was equivalent to that of the hAM. Ultrastructural and histological studies demonstrated that epithelial cells on the SM had the typical tightly apposed, polygonal, corneal epithelial cell morphology. The epithelial cells were well stratified on the SM, unlike on the hAM and FDAM. Rapid wound healing occurred on the SM within 3 days. Immunofluorescence studies showed positive expression of CK-19, Col-1, laminin, ZO-1, FN, and p-63 on the SM, plastic, and FDAM compared to positive expression of ZO-1, Col-1, laminin, FN, and p63 and negative expression of CK-19 in the hAM. Conclusions: These results indicate that the SM is a better substrate for limbal epithelial cell migration, proliferation, and tight junction formation. Altogether, the SM can provide a suitable alternative to the hAM for surgical application in sight-restoring operations.

On interaction between fatigue of reconstruction plate and time-dependent bone remodeling,Wan B.; Yoda N.; Zheng K.; Zhang Z.; Wu C.; Clark J.; Sasaki K.; Swain M.; Li Q.,2022,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105483,"Background and objective: The fibula free flap (FFF) has been extensively used to repair large segmental bone defects in the maxillofacial region. The reconstruction plate plays a key role in maintaining stability and load-sharing while the fibula unites with adjacent bone in the course of healing and remodeling. However, not all fibula flaps would fully unite, and fatigue of prosthetic devices has been recognized as one major concern for long-term load-bearing applications. This study aims to develop a numerical approach for predicting the fatigue life of the reconstruction plate by taking into account the effect of ongoing bone remodeling. Methods: The patient-specific mandible reconstruction with a prosthetic system is studied in this work. The 3D finite element model with heterogeneous material properties obtained from clinical computerized tomography (CT) data is developed for bone, and eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is adopted for the fatigue analysis of the plate. During the remodeling process, the changing apparent density and Young's modulus of bone are simulated in a step-wise fashion on the basis of Wolff's law, which is correlated with the specific clinical follow-up. The maximum biting forces were considered as the driving force on the bone remodeling, which are measured clinically at different time points (4, 16 and 28 months) after reconstruction surgery. Results: Under various occlusal loadings, the interaction between fatigue crack growth and bone remodeling is investigated to gain new insights for the future design of prosthetic devices. The simulation results reveal that appropriate remodeling of grafted bone could extend the fatigue life of fixation plates in a positive way. On the other hand, the rising occlusal load associated with healing and remodeling could lead to fatigue fracture of fixation plate and potentially cause severe bone resorption.

An in-silico bone drilling protocol to control thrust forces using finite element analysis coupled with the constitutive models,Prasannavenkadesan V.; Pandithevan P.,2022,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science",10.1177/09544062221088403,"In orthopaedic surgeries, drilling through bone is most widely used to fix the plates and implants. The uncontrolled large thrust forces generated during bone drilling cause micro-crack, and fragmentation around the local host bone which further loosen the implant and fixation. Owing to the experimental limitation and the risk of infection in handling the bone specimens, conducting experiments with all possible combinations of parameter values and selecting the suitable combination is largely limited. So in this paper, finite element analysis coupled with the constitutive models was used to early predict the thrust forces generated in the surgical bone drilling process. The constitutive models developed in the earlier study, namely, Johnson–Cook, Cowper–Symonds, and Johnson–Cook combined with Cowper–Symonds that consider the strain rate dependence of plastic curve were used for the simulations. Results revealed that the trends of the thrust force values predicted from the constitutive models matched well with the experiments. However, the study showed that the Johnson–Cook model combined with the Cowper–Symonds model predicted the thrust forces with a maximum error of only 9.51% followed by the Johnson–Cook model and Cowper–Symonds model with 15.83% and 21.89%, respectively. The outcomes of the study can be used to predict the thrust forces generated in the bone drilling process, and thus, suitable parameters values can be selected to avoid the mechanical damages around the bone drilling site.

Finite element (FE) simulations are commonly used to assess micromotions at the bone-implant interface during daily activities, requiring accurate computational models. A key factor is the material model used to simulate bone properties. This study evaluated two plastic material models—Isotropic Crushable Foam (ICF) and softening Von-Mises (sVM)—for predicting primary fixation in femoral TKA components. Mechanical tests on human femoral trabecular bone samples under cyclic loading were replicated using FE simulations with ICF and sVM models. These models were then applied to FE simulations of three femoral TKA reconstructions, representing patients aged 57, 73, and 90 years. The ICF model replicated the gradual plastic deformation observed in experiments, unlike the sVM model, and more closely matched the permanent deformation of bone samples. In primary fixation simulations, micromotions at the bone-implant interface averaged 27 µm with ICF and 17 µm with sVM. While both predictions fall within acceptable ranges, the ICF model, as a pressure-dependent material model, more accurately replicates experimental energy dissipation and plastic deformation patterns, closely mirroring human bone's plastic behavior.

Many existing approaches rely on complex and time-consuming 3D digital models to reconstruct facial features for simulating facial plastic surgery outcomes. Some recent research performed a simple affine transformation approach based on 2D images to simulate double eyelid surgery outcomes. However, these methods have faced challenges, such as generating unnatural simulation outcomes and requiring manual removal of masks from images. To address these issues, we have pioneered the use of an unsupervised generative model to generate post-operative double eyelid images. Firstly, we created a dataset involving pre- and post-operative 2D images of double eyelid surgery. Secondly, we proposed a novel attention-class activation map module, which was embedded in a generative adversarial model to facilitate translating a single eyelid image to a double eyelid image. This innovative module enables the generator to selectively focus on the eyelid region that differentiates between the source and target domain, while enhancing the discriminator’s ability to discern differences between real and generated images.

Usefulness of mirror image processing software for creating images of expected appearance after blepharoptosis surgery,"Mawatari, Yuki and Kawaji, Takahiro and Kakizaki, Hirohiko and Vaidya, Aric and Takahashi, Yasuhiro",2021,International Ophthalmology,Springer,Purpose To evaluate the usefulness of mirror image processing software for creating images of expected appearance after blepharoptosis surgery. Methods This retrospective study included 35 patients who underwent blepharoptosis surgery. Preoperative photographs were processed using mirror image software to create images simulating the expected postoperative appearance by mirroring the contralateral eyelid. The simulated images were compared with actual postoperative photographs taken 3 months after surgery. The degree of agreement between simulated and actual postoperative images was assessed using subjective evaluation by patients and surgeons and objective measurements of eyelid parameters. Results The simulated images closely resembled the actual postoperative appearance in most cases. Both patients and surgeons reported high satisfaction with the accuracy of the simulated images. Objective measurements showed no significant differences between simulated and actual postoperative eyelid parameters. Conclusions Mirror image processing software is useful for creating images that simulate the expected postoperative appearance after blepharoptosis surgery.

3d-printed sacral reconstruction prosthesis from multiscale topology optimization: A comprehensive numerical assessment of mechanical stability,Jitkla N.; Pinyonitikasem A.; Wiwatsuwan P.; Pairojboriboon S.; Promoppatum P.,2025,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.109562,"Sacral chordoma, an invasive tumor, necessitates surgical removal of the tumor and the affected region of the sacrum, disrupting the spinopelvic connection. Conventional reconstruction methods, relying on rod and screw systems, often face challenges such as rod failure, sub-optimal stability, and limited osseointegration. This study proposes a novel design for a porous-based sacral reconstruction prosthesis. The design framework involves a two-step topology optimization (TO) process. The first TO step is utilized to obtain the external shape of a patient-specific prosthesis, while the second TO step determines varied density fields. These fields are later integrated with graded Gyroid structures to generate the porous-based sacral prosthesis. Finite element simulations reveal several benefits of the newly developed device. Firstly, considering only solid-based TO tends to result in a highly rigid spinal movement, which may not be entirely favorable. However, the porous-based technique allows for a wider design space, enabling the sacral device's stiffness to be more comprehensively engineered. Secondly, with porous integration, the prosthesis shows potential for promoting bone integration over time, thereby providing further biological fixation and improving long-term structural stability. Thirdly, the porous-based prosthesis outperforms conventional methods such as four-rod reconstruction (FRR) and four-rod plus anterior column reconstruction (FRACR) by reducing maximum von Mises stress in the instruments by approximately 50–80 %. In summary, this study demonstrates how a two-step TO framework can create a superior sacral prosthesis, enhancing its mechanical performance and impact on spinopelvic stability. This suggests potential improvement for similar orthopedic devices in the future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Focuses solely on mechanical stability and structural design of sacral prostheses, without covering automatic prediction or assessment of how surgical outcomes look."

Current reconstruction algorithms mainly generate reference models from the image analysis aspect, however, clinical indicators of the CMF reference model mostly consider the distribution of anatomical landmarks. Generating a reference model with optimal clinical evaluation helps promote the feasibility of an algorithm. Methods: We first build a dataset with 100 normal skull models and then calculate a statistical shape model (SSM) and the distribution of normal cephalometric values, which indicate the statistical features of a population. To further generate personalized reference models, we apply non-rigid registration to align the SSM with the defect skull model. An evaluation standard to select the optimal reference model considers both global performance and anatomical evaluation. Moreover, we develop a landmark detection network to improve the automatic level of the algorithm. Results: The proposed method performs better than methods including Iterative Closest Point and SSM. From a global evaluation aspect, the results show that the RMSE between the reference model and the ground truth is 1.71 ± 0.23 mm, the percentage of vertices with error below 2 mm is 85 ± 4 % and the average faces distance is 1.38 ± 0.20 mm (better than the state-of-the-art method). From the anatomical evaluation aspect, the target registration error between the landmark pairs is 4.12 ± 2.27 mm. In addition, the clinical application confirms that the reference model can meet clinical requirements. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first CMF reconstruction method considering the global performance of reconstruction and anatomically local evaluation from clinical experience. Simulated experiments and clinical cases prove the general applicability and strength of the method. © 2022, CARS.",FALSE,

Modeling fibrous soft tissue dissection with elastic-plastic deformation for simulation of brain tumor removal,Li Z.; Liu P.X.; Hou W.,2023,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107420,"Background and objective: Realistic modeling the dissection of brain tissue is of key importance for simulation of brain tumor removal in virtual neurosurgery systems. However, existing methods are unable to characterize inelastic behaviors of brain tissue, such as plastic deformation and dissection evolution, making it ineffective in simulating brain tumor removal procedures. Methods: In this paper, a model of fibrous soft tissue dissection for the simulation of brain tumor removal is proposed. A dissection variable of representative volume element is used to characterize the dissection state of the fibrous soft tissue. The evolution of dissection with elastic-plastic deformation under the effects of external loads is presented. Results: Simulation results show that the proposed model provides realistic, stable and intuitive results in the simulation of fracture in fibrous soft tissues. As the external load increases, the fibrous soft tissue begins to crack, with the cracks growing and multiplying until they eventually merge to form a fracture. The proposed model is incorporated into the simulation of brain tumor removal. Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of modeling fibrous soft tissue dissection with elastic-plastic deformation.

3D Facial Plastic Surgery Simulation: Based on the Structured Light,Rao Z.; Sun S.; Li M.; Ji X.; Huang J.,2023,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),10.3390/app13010659,"3D quantitative analysis of facial morphology is of importance in plastic surgery (PS), which could help surgeons design appropriate procedures before conducting the surgery. We propose a system to simulate and guide the shaping effect analysis, which could produce a similar but more harmonious face simulation. To this end, first, the depth camera based on structured light coding is employed for facial 3D data acquisition, from which the point cloud data of multiple facial perspectives could be obtained. Next, the cascade regression tree algorithm is used to extract the esthetic key points of the face model and to calculate the facial features composed of the key points, such as the nose, chin, and eyes. Quantitative facial esthetic indexes are offered to doctors to simulate PS. Afterward, we exploit a face mesh metamorphosis based on finite elements. We design several morphing operators, including augmentation, cutting, and lacerating. Finally, the regional deformation is detected, and the operation effect is quantitatively evaluated by registering the 3D scanning model before and after the operation. The test of our proposed system and the simulation of PS operations find that the measurement error of facial geometric features is 0.458 mm, and the area is 0.65 mm2. The ratings of the simulation outcomes provided by panels of PS prove that the system is effective. The manipulated 3D faces are deemed more beautiful compared to the original faces respecting the beauty canons such as facial symmetry and the golden ratio. The proposed algorithm could generate realistic visual effects of PS simulation. It could thus assist the preoperative planning of facial PS. © 2023 by the authors.",FALSE,

Central and two different types of lateral segmental defects were created on mandibular model that was generated from computed tomography of a male patient. Segmental defects were fixed with conventional locking reconstruction plates and two different custom designed plates with caudobuccal and dorsobuccal cover. Stress formation on hardware and screws, strain on bone under masticatory simulation were evaluated with a finite element model. The stress values on plate and screws were higher in conventional reconstruction plate than custom plates. Simulations of central segmental defect revealed maximum von Mises stresses of 643.62 MPa and 101.83 MPa in conventional reconstruction plate and biplanar plate, respectively. Biplanar plates revealed slightly higher von Mises stresses than extended surfaced biplanar plates. The screws close to resection area were exposed to higher stress than farther screws for whole groups. In conventional reconstruction plate, the maximum von Mises stress values of fixation screws were 268.66 MPa and 95 MPa for central segmental defect and lateral segmental defect, respectively.

The Association Between Geometry and Wall Stress in Emergently Repaired Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,Chauhan S.S.; Gutierrez C.A.; Thirugnanasambandam M.; De Oliveira V.; Muluk S.C.; Eskandari M.K.; Finol E.A.,2017,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10439-017-1837-1,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a prevalent cardiovascular disease characterized by the focal dilation of the aorta, which supplies blood to all the organs and tissues in the systemic circulation. With the AAA increasing in diameter over time, the risk of aneurysm rupture is generally associated with the size of the aneurysm. If diagnosed on time, intervention is recommended to prevent AAA rupture. The criterion to decide on surgical intervention is determined by measuring the maximum diameter of the aneurysm relative to the critical value of 5.5 cm. However, a more reliable approach could be based on understanding the biomechanical behavior of the aneurysmal wall. In addition, geometric features that are proven to be significant predictors of the AAA wall mechanics could be used as surrogates of the AAA biomechanical behavior and, subsequently, of the aneurysm’s risk of rupture. The aim of this work is to identify those geometric indices that have a high correlation with AAA wall stress in the population of patients who received an emergent repair of their aneurysm. In-house segmentation and meshing algorithms were used to model 75 AAAs followed by estimation of the spatially distributed wall stress by performing finite element analysis. Fifty-two shape and size geometric indices were calculated for the same models using MATLAB scripting. Hypotheses testing were carried out to identify the indices significantly correlated with wall stress by constructing a Pearson’s correlation coefficient matrix. The analyses revealed that 12 indices displayed high correlation with the wall stress, amongst which wall thickness and curvature-based indices exhibited the highest correlations. Stepwise regression analysis of these correlated indices indicated that wall stress can be predicted by the following four indices with an accuracy of 76%: maximum aneurysm diameter, aneurysm sac length, average wall thickness at the maximum diameter cross-section, and the median of the wall thickness variance. The primary outcome of this work emphasizes the use of global measures of size and wall thickness as geometric surrogates of wall stress for emergently repaired AAAs. © 2017, Biomedical Engineering Society.",FALSE,

A new deformation simulation algorithm for elastic-plastic objects based on splat primitives,Zou Y.; Liu P.X.,2017,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.02.007,"To achieve high computational efficiency and realistic visual effects, a new simulation algorithm for soft tissue deformation, which is based on a shape-matching scheme using splat primitives, is presented for interactive real-time applications, such as surgery simulation and video games. The most important novelty of the proposed approach lies in the fact that surface splats instead of points are employed in the computation of the deformation and fracturing of an elastic-plastic object. By controlling the sampling density and automatically adjusting the size of the circular splats, the surface of the simulated object can be seamlessly covered with a much small number of splats than points. Splats are then divided into clusters using the K-Means clustering algorithm. As a result, the elastic-plastic deformation of these clusters can be simulated using a shape-matching strategy, allowing more degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the simulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enormously reduces memory space and greatly improves computational efficiency (approximately twice in simulating plastic deformations compared with classical shape-matching methods), making it more suitable for interactive and real-time applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Focuses on simulating soft tissue movement for interactive use, not on automatically predicting or evaluating surgical aesthetic results."

Postoncologic reconstructive surgery in thoracic diseases might benefit from 3DR models; however, limited data on this application have been published worldwide. In this paper, the aim was to report our experience with 3DR modeling to determine resection and plan the surgical reconstruction in a patient with a desmoid tumor of the chest wall. For a better understanding of the case study, we describe all the steps from acquiring computed tomography (CT) scans to the final 3D rendering. A 68-year-old, non-smoking man presented at our outpatient department with painless swelling of the right anterobasal chest wall. A thorax–abdomen–brain CT scan revealed homogenous solid tissue with a dense mass measuring 80 mm × 62 mm. The final 3D model was evaluated by the surgical team (three medical doctors), who found the model to be powerful. Based on the results and the accuracy of the model, the multidisciplinary team decided that the tumor was resectable. Consequently, a surgical plan based on the 3D model was developed to perform chest wall reconstruction after radical resection. The patient underwent right anterolateral thoracotomy at the seventh intercostal space, which confirmed the CT scan findings and revealed infiltration of the serratus muscle and medial portion of the diaphragm. A radical tumor en bloc resection with chest wall and diaphragm resection was performed. The full-thickness chest wall and diaphragm defects were reconstructed using two separate biological patches of a porcine dermal collagen implant (Permacol™ Surgical Implant). Postoperative X-ray revealed unremarkable findings; the patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged 6 days after surgery.

Tool to visualize and evaluate operator proficiency in laser hair-removal treatments,Noh S.; Koh W.S.; Lim H.-W.; Yoon C.; Kim Y.; Chung J.H.; Kim H.C.; Kim S.,2014,BioMedical Engineering Online,10.1186/1475-925X-13-40,"Background: The uniform delivery of laser energy is particularly important for safe and effective laser hair removal (LHR) treatment. Although it is necessary to quantitatively assess the spatial distribution of the delivered laser, laser spots are difficult to trace owing to a lack of visual cues. This study proposes a novel preclinic tool to evaluate operator proficiency in LHR treatment and applies this tool to train novice operators and compare two different treatment techniques (sliding versus spot-by-spot). Methods: A simulation bed is constructed to visualize the irradiated laser spots. Six novice operators are recruited to perform four sessions of simulation while changing the treatment techniques and the presence of feedback (sliding without feedback, sliding with feedback, spot-by-spot without feedback, and spot-by-spot with feedback). Laser distribution maps (LDMs) are reconstructed through a series of images processed from the recorded video for each simulation session. Then, an experienced dermatologist classifies the collected LDMs into three different performance groups, which are quantitatively analyzed in terms of four performance indices. Results: The performance groups are characterized by using a combination of four proposed indices. The best-performing group exhibited the lowest amount of randomness in laser delivery and accurate estimation of mean spot distances. The training was only effective in the sliding treatment technique. After the training, omission errors decreased by 6.32% and better estimation of the mean spot distance of the actual size of the laser-emitting window was achieved. Gels required operators to be trained when the spot-by-spot technique was used, and imposed difficulties in maintaining regular laser delivery when the sliding technique was used. Conclusions: Because the proposed system is simple and highly affordable, it is expected to benefit many operators in clinics to train and maintain skilled performance in LHR treatment, which will eventually lead to accomplishing a uniform laser delivery for safe and effective LHR treatment. © 2014 Noh et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",TRUE,Focuses on training skills for laser hair removal instead of using automation to predict or assess aesthetic results in plastic or cancer-related surgery.

To date, however, only ten surgeries have included underlying skeletal and jaw-teeth components, all yielding sub-optimal results and a need for a subsequent revision surgery, due to size mismatch and lack of precise planning. Numerous studies have proven swine to be appropriate candidates for translational studies including pre-operative planning of transplantation. An important aspect of planning FJTT is determining the optimal muscle attachment sites on the recipient’s jaw, which requires a clear understanding of mastication and bite mechanics in relation to the new donated upper and/or lower jaw. A segmented CT scan coupled with data taken from literature defined a biomechanical model of mandible and jaw muscles of a swine. The model was driven using tracked motion and external force data of one cycle of chewing published earlier, and predicted the muscle activation patterns as well as temporomandibular joint (TMJ) reaction forces and condylar motions. Two methods, polynomial and min/max optimization, were used for solving the muscle recruitment problem. Similar performances were observed between the two methods. On average, there was a mean absolute error (MAE) of <0.08 between the predicted and measured activation levels of all muscles, and an MAE of <7. N for TMJ reaction forces. Simulated activations qualitatively followed the same patterns as the reference data and there was very good agreement for simulated TMJ forces. The polynomial optimization produced a smoother output, suggesting that it is more suitable for studying such motions. Average MAE for condylar motion was 1.2. mm, which reduced to 0.37. mm when the input incisor motion was scaled to reflect the possible size mismatch between the current and original swine models.

A wear model previously developed by the authors for metal-on-plastic hip implants was adapted to RTSAs and applied in a double direction: firstly, to evaluate specific wear coefficients for RTSAs from experimental results and secondly, to predict wear distribution. In both cases, the Archard wear law (AR) and the wear law of UHMWPE (PE) were considered, assuming four different k functions. The results indicated that both the wear laws predict higher wear coefficients for RTSA with respect to hip implants, particularly the AR law, with k values higher than twofold the hip ones. Such differences can significantly affect predictive wear model results for RTSA, when non-specific wear coefficients are used. Moreover, the wear maps simulated with the two laws are markedly different, although providing the same wear volume. A higher wear depth (+51%) is obtained with the AR law, located at the dome of the cup, while with the PE law the most worn region is close to the edge.

The meta-analysis showed a significant improvement in self-esteem (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45 to 1.11; p < 0.001) and body image (SMD = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.18; p < 0.001) after cosmetic surgery. Subgroup analyses indicated that the effect was consistent across different types of cosmetic surgery and follow-up durations. Conclusion Cosmetic surgery has a positive effect on self-esteem and body image based on clinical trial evidence. These findings support the psychological benefits of cosmetic surgery, but further high-quality trials with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these results.",FALSE,
A novel approach to keypoint detection for the aesthetic evaluation of breast cancer surgery outcomes,"Gon{\c{c}}alves, Tiago and Silva, Wilson and Cardoso, Maria J and Cardoso, Jaime S",2020,Health and Technology,Springer,"Breast cancer surgery is a common treatment for breast cancer patients, and the aesthetic outcome of the surgery is an important factor affecting patients’ quality of life. Traditional methods for evaluating the aesthetic outcome rely on subjective assessments by clinicians, which can be inconsistent and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to keypoint detection for the aesthetic evaluation of breast cancer surgery outcomes. Our method utilizes deep learning techniques to automatically detect keypoints on breast images, enabling objective and reproducible measurements of surgical results. We validate our approach on a dataset of postoperative breast images and demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing relevant aesthetic features. The proposed method has the potential to assist clinicians in providing standardized and quantitative assessments of breast surgery outcomes, ultimately improving patient care.",FALSE,
A model of articular cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery: A validation construct and computational insights,Salehghaffari S.; Dhaher Y.Y.,2014,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.03.003,"This study sought to develop a computational framework that emulates the articular cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery using transtibial portal technique. The proposed model included the tibia-femoral and patella-femoral joints, articular cartilage and menisci. Key surgical parameters were incorporated including bone-patellar-tendon-bone graft excision and pre-tensioning, tunnel morphology, bone plugs, and bone plug fixation. Several simulation steps were parameterized to reflect the clinically reported surgical procedure. Our focus was to explore the intra-operative effects of variations in tunnel directions on the selected metrics of joint mechanics during Lachman and Anterior Drawer tests. A mathematical construct capable of transforming the limited and heterogeneous experimental and surgical data to evidence-based validation was adopted to ensure the viability of the finite element models. We found that the proposed models, subject to a variation in tunnel directions, resulted in simulation outputs that favor the reported experimental data of Lachman and Anterior Drawer tests under uncertainty. Simulation results for a population of three-dimensional tunnel orientations provided insights into the graft-tunnel contact mechanics and the spatial stress distribution in the graft, insights that have been anecdotally observed in prior experimental studies. The intraarticular graft tension was found to be higher than the estimated in tunnel graft force, and larger differences were found for the least inclined tunnels exhibiting higher contact pressures, transverse bending and twisting of the graft and Von-Mises stress at the graft-femoral tunnel interface. Conversely, tunnels with high inclination angles exhibited higher intraarticular graft tension and Von-Mises stress at the graft-tibial bone plug interface. © 2014.",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical modeling of ligament reconstruction and doesn't cover automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery, so it doesn't fit the review's topic."
Finite element analysis of customized reconstruction plates for mandibular continuity defect therapy,Narra N.; Valášek J.; Hannula M.; Marcián P.; Sándor G.K.; Hyttinen J.; Wolff J.,2014,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2013.11.016,"Finite element analysis of customized reconstruction plates for mandibular continuity defect therapy  Large mandibular continuity defects pose a significant challenge in oral maxillofacial surgery. One solution to this problem is to use computer-guided surgical planning and additive manufacturing technology to produce patient-specific reconstruction plates. However, when designing customized plates, it is important to assess potential biomechanical responses that may vary substantially depending on the size and geometry of the defect. The aim of this study was to assess the design of two customized plates using finite element method (FEM). These plates were designed for the reconstruction of the lower left mandibles of two ameloblastoma cases (patient 1/plate 1 and patient 2/plate 2) with large bone resections differing in both geometry and size. Simulations revealed maximum von Mises stresses of 63. MPa and 108. MPa in plates 1 and 2, and 65. MPa and 190. MPa in the fixation screws of patients 1 and 2. The equivalent strain induced in the bone at the screw-bone interface reached maximum values of 2739 micro-strain for patient 1 and 19,575 micro-strain for patient 2. The results demonstrate the influence of design on the stresses induced in the plate and screw bodies. Of particular note, however, are the differences in the induced strains. Unphysiologically high strains in bone adjacent to screws can cause micro-damage leading to bone resorption. This can adversely affect the anchoring capabilities of the screws. Thus, while custom plates offer optimal anatomical fit, attention should be paid to the expected physiological forces on the plates and the induced stresses and strains in the plate-screw-bone assembly. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",FALSE,
Improving tissue expansion protocols through computational modeling,Lee T.; Vaca E.E.; Ledwon J.K.; Bae H.; Topczewska J.M.; Turin S.Y.; Kuhl E.; Gosain A.K.; Tepole A.B.,2018,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2018.03.034,"Tissue expansion is a common technique in reconstructive surgery used to grow skin in vivo for correction of large defects. Despite its popularity, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of how stretch leads to growth of new skin. This has resulted in several arbitrary expansion protocols that rely on the surgeon's personal training and experience rather than on accurate predictive models. For example, choosing between slow or rapid expansion, or small or large inflation volumes remains controversial. Here we explore four tissue expansion protocols by systematically varying the inflation volume and the protocol duration in a porcine model. The quantitative analysis combines three-dimensional photography, isogeometric kinematics, and finite growth theory. Strikingly, all four protocols generate similar peak stretches, but different growth patterns: Smaller filling volumes of 30 ml per inflation did not result in notable expander-induced growth neither for the short nor for the long protocol; larger filling volumes of 60 ml per inflation trigger skin adaptation, with larger expander-induced growth in regions of larger stretch, and more expander-induced growth for the 14-day compared to the 10-day expansion protocol. Our results suggest that expander-induced growth is not triggered by the local stretch alone. While stretch is clearly a driver for growth, the local stretch at a given point is not enough to predict the expander-induced growth at that location. From a clinical perspective, our study suggests that longer expansion protocols are needed to ensure sufficient growth of sizable skin patches. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical modeling of tissue expansion without covering automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results, so it doesn't fit the review on aesthetic assessment in surgery."
High-Frequency Ultrasonic Forceps for the in Vivo Detection of Cancer during Breast-Conserving Surgery,Doyle T.E.; Butler A.P.; Salisbury M.J.; Bennett M.J.; Wagner G.M.; Al-Ghaib H.A.; Matsen C.B.,2020,"Journal of Medical Devices, Transactions of the ASME",10.1115/1.4047115,"A major aim in the surgical management of soft tissue cancers is to detect and remove all cancerous tissues while ensuring noncancerous tissue remains intact. Breast-conserving surgery provides a prime illustration of this aim, since remaining cancer in breast margins results in multiple surgeries, while removal of too much unaffected tissue often has undesirable cosmetic effects. Similarly, resection of benign lymph nodes during sentinel lymph node biopsy can cause deleterious health outcomes. The objective of this study was to create an intraoperative, in vivo device to address these challenges. Instant diagnostic information generated by this device could allow surgeons to precisely and completely remove all malignant tissue during the first surgery. Surgical forceps based on Martin forceps were instrumented at the tips with high-frequency ultrasonic transducers composed of polyvinylidene difluoride, a thickness-sensing rotary potentiometer at the base, and a spring to provide the appropriate restoring force. Transducer wires within the forceps were connected to an external high-frequency pulser-receiver, activating the forceps' transmitting transducer at 50 MHz and amplifying through-transmission signals from the receiving transducer. The forceps were tested with tissue-mimicking agarose phantoms embedded with 58-550 μm polyethylene microspheres to simulate various stages of cancer progression and to provide a range of measurement values. Results were compared with measurements from standard 50 MHz immersion transducers. The results showed that the forceps displayed similar sensitivity for attenuation and increased accuracy for wave speed. The forceps could also be extended to endoscopes and laparoscopes. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Mechanical properties of PVA material for tissue engineering applications,Karimi A.; Navidbakhsh M.,2014,Materials Technology,10.1179/1753555713Y.0000000115,"The paper presents the first scientific study of the quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) sponges. The PVA sponges have been considered as a potential implant material for replacement and repair of the soft tissues, including cartilage, liver and kidney. It is also used in ophthalmic surgical treatment, such as Lasik, cataract and refractive surgeries, to manipulate tissue during incision procedures in the eye to absorb fluid. However, a critical barrier to the use of the PVA sponge as a tissue replacement material is the lack of sufficient mechanical properties. In this study, the non-linear mechanical behaviour of a PVA sponge is investigated experimentally and computationally. A series of tension tests are designed and conducted for the PVA sponge. Hyperelastic strain energy density functions, including Yeoh, Ogden, Mooney-Rivlin and Neo-Hookean, are calibrated using the experimental data. A hyperelastic constitutive model is selected to best fit the axial behaviour of the sponge. Its general prediction ability is verified using finite element simulations of PVA tensile experiments. The results in terms of the maximum stress before the holding for the P sponge demonstrate that it can bear 11–94% and 20–17% more stress compared to the EYETEC and CENEFOM sponges respectively. The swelling ratio of the P sponge was 26–78 and 1–78% more than that of the CENEFOM and EYETEC sponges respectively. Moreover, the Yeoh model was selected to represent the non-linear behaviour of the PVA material, which can be used in future biomechanical simulations of the soft tissues. These results can be utilised to understand the QLV and swelling mechanism of PVA sponges and have implications for ophthalmic and plastic surgeries, as well as wound healing and tissue engineering purposes. © 2014 W.

In this study, the biomechanical behavior of 10 canine humeri was compared before and after creation of a 10 mm bone defect stabilized with an eight-hole locking compression plate (Synthes®) and two locking screws on each fragment. The response under compression of both intact and plated samples was measured experimentally and reproduced with a finite element model.

Simulating contact using the elastic foundation algorithm in OpenSim,Hast M.W.; Hanson B.G.; Baxter J.R.,2019,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2018.11.025,"Modeling joint contact in OpenSim is not well understood. This study systematically investigated the variables associated with the elastic foundation contact model within OpenSim by performing a series of controlled benchtop experiment and concomitant simulations. Four metal-on-plastic interactions were modeled, including a model of a total knee replacement (TKR). Load-displacement curves were recorded during cyclic loading between 100 and 750 N. Geometries were imported and into OpenSim and contact mechanics were modeled with the on-board elastic foundation algorithm. A hybrid optimization algorithm determined that stiffness and dissipation coefficients for TKR implants were 1.52 × 10^10 N/m and 57.7 Ns/m, respectively. Estimations of contact forces were 10.2% of blinded experimental data (average root mean square error: 76.82 ± 11.47 N). In the second portion of this study, freely available eTibia TKR renderings were used to test the ubiquity of the tuning parameters. They were also used to perform a sensitivity analysis of material stiffness and mesh density with regard to penetration depth and computational time. When a stiffness of 1 × 10^10 was applied to an eTibia model with 5000 faces, a 100 kg load caused 0.259 mm of penetration. Under the same conditions, the tuned model experienced 0.300 mm of penetration. Material stiffnesses between 1 × 10^13 and 1 × 10^15 N/m increased computation time by factors of 12–23.

Subject-specific finite-element modeling of normal aortic valve biomechanics from 3D+t TEE images,Labrosse M.R.; Beller C.J.; Boodhwani M.; Hudson C.; Sohmer B.,2015,Medical Image Analysis,10.1016/j.media.2014.11.003,"In the past decades, developments in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have opened new horizons in reconstructive surgery of the aortic valve (AV), whereby corrections are made to normalize the geometry and function of the valve, and effectively treat leaks. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first integrated framework to process subject-specific 3D+t TEE AV data, determine age-matched material properties for the aortic and leaflet tissues, build a finite element model of the unpressurized AV, and simulate the AV function throughout a cardiac cycle. For geometric reconstruction purposes, dedicated software was created to acquire the 3-D coordinates of 21 anatomical landmarks of the AV apparatus in a systematic fashion. Measurements from ten 3D+t TEE datasets of normal AVs were assessed for inter- and intra-observer variability. These tests demonstrated mean measurement errors well within the acceptable range. Simulation of a complete cardiac cycle was successful for all ten valves and validated the novel schemes introduced to evaluate age-matched material properties and iteratively scale the unpressurized dimensions of the valves such that, given the determined material properties, the dimensions measured in vivo closely matched those simulated in late diastole. The leaflet coaptation area, describing the quality of the sealing of the valve, was measured directly from the medical images and was also obtained from the simulations; both approaches correlated well.

CPCs are injectable and are chemically resemblant to the mineral phase of native bone. Nevertheless, their low fracture toughness and high brittleness reduce their clinical applicability to weakly loaded bones. Reinforcement of CPC matrix with polymeric fibers can overcome these mechanical drawbacks and significantly enhance their toughness and strength. Such fiber-reinforced calcium phosphate cements (FRCPCs) have the potential to act as advanced bone substitute in load-bearing anatomical sites. This work achieves integrated experimental and numerical characterization of the mechanical properties of FRCPCs under bending and tensile loading. To this end, a 3-D numerical gradient enhanced damage model combined with a dimensionally-reduced fiber model are employed to develop a computational model for material characterization and to simulate the failure process of fiber-reinforced CPC matrix based on experimental data. In addition, an advanced interfacial constitutive law, derived from micromechanical pull-out tests, is used to represent the interaction between the polymeric fiber and CPC matrix.

Modelling and structural analysis of skull/cranial implant: Beyond mid-line deformities,Bogu V.P.; Ravi Kumar Y.; Khanara A.K.,2017,Acta of Bioengineering and Biomechanics,10.5277/ABB-00547-2016-04,"Purpose: This computational study explores modelling and finite element study of the implant under Intracranial pressure (ICP) conditions with normal ICP range (7 mm Hg to 15 mm Hg) or increased ICP (>I5 mm Hg). The implant fixation points allow implant behaviour with respect to intracranial pressure conditions. However, increased fixation points lead to variation in deformation and equivalent stress. Finite element analysis is providing a valuable insight to know the deformation and equivalent stress. Methods: The patient CT data (Computed Tomography) is processed in Mimics software to get the mesh model. The implant is modelled by using modified reverse engineering technique with the help of Rhinoceros software. This modelling method is applicable for all types of defects including those beyond the middle line and multiple ones. It is designed with eight fixation points and ten fixation points to fix an implant. Consequently, the mechanical deformation and equivalent stress (von Mises) are calculated in ANSYS 15 software with distinctive material properties such as Titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK). Results: The deformation and equivalent stress results are obtained through ANSYS 15 software. It is observed that Ti6Al4V material shows low deformation and PEEK material shows less equivalent stress. Among all materials PEEK shows noticeably good result. Conclusions: Hence, a concept was established and more clinically relevant results can be expected with implementation of realistic 3D printed model in the future.

The suggested model is characterized by three unknown parameters, friction coefficient, shear stress softening and contact stiffness. In the absence of any isolated experiments exploring the graft-tunnel interactions during an aggregate joint load, the calibration data used in this study are derived from a reported biomechanical study. A Bayesian calibration procedure was employed to find the unknown probability distribution function (PDF) of these contact parameters. Initially, the response surface approximations of the predicted graft forces from laxity test simulations was adopted to estimate the likelihood of noisy experimental data reported in the literature. Then, the wide domain of contact parameters was sampled sequentially based on the Marcov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with acceptance-rejection criteria to search for population of samples in significantly narrower domain of unknown parameters that are associated with the highest occurrence likelihood of noisy experimental data. Our simulations with calibrated contact parameters indicate that pre-tensioning applied at 30° of flexion leads to larger graft force after the joint is fully extended compared to the graft force when the same pre-tensioning force is applied at full extension. Moreover, regardless of the pre-tensioning force, the graft-tunnel contact pressure is larger when the fixation of the graft is performed at full extension, increasing with the pre-tensioning force. © 2015.",TRUE,"Centers on biomechanical modeling in ACL reconstruction without discussing automatic prediction or assessment of aesthetics in plastic or cancer surgery, so it doesn't align with the review's focus."

Recent development of a computer-assisted planning and execution (CAPE) system for Le Fort-based FJTT in a pre-clinical swine model offers preoperative planning, and intraoperative navigation. This paper addresses the translation of the CAPE system to human anatomy and presents accuracy results. Methods: Single-jaw, Le Fort-based FJTTs were performed on plastic models, one swine and one human, and on a human cadaver. Preoperative planning defined the goal placement of the donor’s Le Fort-based FJTT segment on the recipient. Patient-specific navigated cutting guides helped achieve planned osteotomies. Intraoperative cutting guide and donor fragment placement were compared with postoperative computed tomography (CT) data and the preoperative plan. Results: Intraoperative measurement error with respect to postoperative CT was less than 1.25 mm for both mock transplants and 3.59 mm for the human cadaver scenario. Donor fragment placement (as compared to the planned position) was less accurate for the human model test case (2.91 mm) compared with the swine test (2.25 mm) and human cadaver (2.26 mm). Conclusion: The results indicate the viability of the CAPE system for assisting with Le Fort-based FJTT and demonstrate the potential in human surgery.

Virtual downsizing for decision support in mitral valve repair,Neugebauer M.; Tautz L.; Hüllebrand M.; Sündermann S.; Degener F.; Goubergrits L.; Kühne T.; Falk V.; Hennemuth A.,2019,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-018-1868-6,"Purpose: Various options are available for the treatment of mitral valve insufficiency, including reconstructive approaches such as annulus correction through ring implants. The correct choice of general therapy and implant is relevant for an optimal outcome. Additional to guidelines, decision support systems (DSS) can provide decision aid by means of virtual intervention planning and predictive simulations. Our approach on virtual downsizing is one of the virtual intervention tools that are part of the DSS workflow. It allows for emulating a ring implantation based on patient-specific lumen geometry and vendor-specific implants. Methods: Our approach is fully automatic and relies on a lumen mask and an annulus contour as inputs. Both are acquired from previous DSS workflow steps. A virtual surface- and contour-based model of a vendor-specific ring design (26–40 mm) is generated. For each case, the ring geometry is positioned with respect to the original, patient-specific annulus and additional anatomical landmarks. The lumen mesh is parameterized to allow for a vertex-based deformation with respect to the user-defined annulus. Derived from post-interventional observations, specific deformation schemes are applied to atrium and ventricle and the lumen mesh is altered with respect to the ring location. Results: For quantitative evaluation, the surface distance between the deformed lumen mesh and segmented post-operative echo lumen close to the annulus was computed for 11 datasets. The results indicate a good agreement. An arbitrary subset of six datasets was used for a qualitative evaluation of the complete lumen. Two domain experts compared the deformed lumen mesh with post-interventional echo images. All deformations were deemed plausible.

Conceptual design and implantation of an external fixator with improved mobility for knee rehabilitation,Gatti G.,2017,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1080/10255842.2017.1307342,"A hinged external fixator is used to allow early knee rehabilitation in case of injury or trauma, as an alternative approach to immobilization. It is mainly adopted for the treatment of dislocations, which involve tearing of the ligaments, and it basically consists of two links connected to each other by a revolute joint. Each link is fixed to the femur and tibia via pin fixation, and the revolute joint is approximately aligned to the knee flexion-extension (FE) axis. The advantage in its implantation is to protect ligament reconstruction, while allowing for an aggressive rehabilitation. Traditional fixators only accommodate the functional flexion movement in a limited range, i.e. where the anatomical movement is closer to a planar circular trajectory. This paper presents the conceptual design and implantation procedure of a double-axis fixator, which accommodates both FE and longitudinal internal-external rotation. The procedure is based on accurate knee kinematics measurements and on computer-aided multibody simulations to assist clinicians in the implantation.

Machine learning and surgical outcomes prediction: a systematic review,"Elfanagely, Omar and Toyoda, Yoshiko and Othman, Sammy and Mellia, Joseph A and Basta, Marten and Liu, Tony and Kording, Konrad and Ungar, Lyle and Fischer, John P",2021,Journal of Surgical Research,Elsevier,"Background: Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions. ML has been increasingly applied in surgery to predict outcomes and improve patient care. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current evidence on the use of ML for surgical outcomes prediction.  Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in multiple databases to identify studies that applied ML techniques to predict surgical outcomes. Studies were screened, and data were extracted on ML methods, surgical specialties, outcomes predicted, and performance metrics.  Results: A total of 45 studies met inclusion criteria, encompassing various surgical specialties including general surgery, orthopedics, and neurosurgery. ML models demonstrated promising predictive performance for outcomes such as postoperative complications, mortality, and length of stay. Commonly used algorithms included random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. However, heterogeneity in study design, outcome definitions, and ML methodologies was noted.  Conclusions: ML shows potential in predicting surgical outcomes and aiding clinical decision-making. Nevertheless, further research with standardized methodologies and external validation is necessary to translate these models into clinical practice effectively.

Linear Elastic Properties of the Facial Soft Tissues Using an Aspiration Device: Towards Patient Specific Characterization,Luboz V.; Promayon E.; Payan Y.,2014,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10439-014-1098-1,"Biomechanical modeling of the facial soft tissue behavior is needed in aesthetic or maxillo-facial surgeries where the simulation of the bone displacements cannot accurately predict the visible outcome on the patient’s face. Because these tissues have different nature and elastic properties across the face, depending on their thickness, and their content in fat or muscle, individualizing their mechanical parameters could increase the simulation accuracy. Using a specifically designed aspiration device, the facial soft tissues deformation is measured at four different locations (cheek, cheekbone, forehead, and lower lip) on 16 young subjects. The stiffness is estimated from the deformations generated by a set of negative pressures using an inverse analysis based on a Neo Hookean model. The initial Young’s modulus of the cheek, cheekbone, forehead, and lower lip are respectively estimated to be 31.0 kPa ± 4.6, 34.9 kPa ± 6.6, 17.3 kPa ± 4.1, and 33.7 kPa ± 7.3. Significant intra-subject differences in tissue stiffness are highlighted by these estimations. They also show important inter-subject variability for some locations even when mean stiffness values show no statistical difference.

PlasticGAN: Holistic generative adversarial network on face plastic and aesthetic surgery,"Chandaliya, Praveen Kumar and Nain, Neeta",2022,Multimedia Tools and Applications,Springer,"Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. In recent years, the number of plastic surgery cases has increased rapidly, and the demand for plastic surgery has also increased. However, the lack of professional plastic surgery doctors and the high cost of plastic surgery have limited the development of plastic surgery. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a holistic generative adversarial network (PlasticGAN) for face plastic and aesthetic surgery. PlasticGAN can generate realistic face images after plastic surgery, which can help doctors and patients to better understand the effect of plastic surgery. Specifically, PlasticGAN consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator is designed to generate face images after plastic surgery, and the discriminator is designed to distinguish between real and generated images. Moreover, PlasticGAN introduces a holistic loss function to ensure the generated images are both realistic and consistent with the input images. Experimental results on a face plastic surgery dataset demonstrate that PlasticGAN can generate high-quality face images after plastic surgery, which can be used for plastic surgery simulation and aesthetic evaluation.",FALSE,

Control of the micromovements of a composite-material nail design: A finite element analysis,Ben-Or M.; Shavit R.; Ben-Tov T.; Salai M.; Steinberg E.L.,2016,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.09.011,"Background: Intramedullary nail fixation is the most accepted modality for stabilizing long bone midshaft fractures. The commercially used nails are fabricated from Stainless Steel or Titanium. Composite-materials (CM) mainly carbon-fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) have been gaining more interest and popularity due to their properties, such as modulus of elasticity close to that of bone, increased fatigue strength, and radio-opacity to irradiation that permits a better visualization of the healing process. The use of CFRP instead of metals allows better control of different directional movements along a fracture site. The purpose of this analysis was to design a CM intramedullary nail to enable micromovements as depicted on a finite element analysis method. Methods: We designed a three-dimentional femoral nail model. Three CFRP with different laminates arrangements, were included in the analysis. The finite element analysis involved applying vertical and horizontal loads on each of the designed and tested nails. Results: The nails permitted a transverse micromovement of 0.75. mm for the 45° lay-up and 1.5. mm for the 90° lay-up for the CM, 1.38. mm for the Titanium and 0.74. mm for the Stainless Steel nails. The recorded axial movements were 0.53. mm for the 45° lay-up, 0.87. mm for the 90° lay-up, 0.46. mm for the unsymmetrical lay-up CM, 0.046 for the Titanium and 0.02 for the Stainless Steel nails. Overall, the simulations showed that nail transverse micromovements can be reduced by using 45° carbon fiber orientations. Similar results were observed with each metal nails. Interpretation: We found that nail micromovements can be controlled by changing the directional stiffness using different lay-up orientations. These results can be useful for predicting nail micromovements under specified loading conditions which are crucial for stimulating callus formation in the early stages of healing. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",TRUE,Focuses on biomechanical analysis of fracture fixation devices and doesn’t cover automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery.

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

The clinical outcomes of AVR are strongly dependent on an appropriate choice of both prosthesis size and replacement technique, which are, at present, strictly related to surgeon's experience and skill. Therefore, also this treatment, like most reconstructive procedures in cardiac surgery, remains ""more art than science"" [1].

Traditional methods, such as mean squared error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), have been widely used but often fail to correlate well with perceived visual quality. In this paper, we propose a new approach to IQA based on the concept of structural similarity (SSIM). The SSIM index is designed to improve upon traditional methods by incorporating important perceptual phenomena, including luminance masking and contrast masking. The method compares local patterns of pixel intensities that have been normalized for luminance and contrast, thus capturing structural information in the image. Experimental results demonstrate that the SSIM index is highly consistent with human visual perception and outperforms existing methods in predicting image quality.

The task of visualization is no longer limited to producing images at interactive rates, but also includes the guided extraction of significant features to assist the user in the data exploration process. An effective visualization module has to perform a problem-specific abstraction of the dataset, leading to a more compact and hence more efficient visual representation. Moreover, many medical applications, such as surgical training simulators and pre-operative planning for plastic and reconstructive surgery, require the visualization of datasets that are dynamically modified or even generated by a physics-based simulation engine. In this paper we present a set of approaches that allow interactive exploration of medical datasets in real time. Our method combines direct volume rendering via ray-casting with a novel approach for isosurface extraction and re-use directly on graphics processing units (GPU)s in a single framework. The isosurface extraction technique takes advantage of the recently introduced Microsoft(R) DirectX®10 pipeline for dynamic surface extraction in real time using geometry shaders. This surface is constructed in polygonal form and can be directly used post-extraction for collision detection, rendering, and optimization. The resulting polygonal surface can also be analyzed for geometric properties, such as feature area, volume and size deviation, which is crucial for semi-automatic tumor analysis as used, for example, in colonoscopy. Additionally, we have developed a technique for real-time volume data analysis by providing an interactive user interface for designing material properties for organs in the scanned volume. Combining isosurface with direct volume rendering allows visualization of the surface properties as well as the context of tissues surrounding the region and gives better context for navigation. Our application can be used with CT and MRI scan data, or with a variety of other medical and scientific applications.

Does graft construct lengthening at the fixations cause an increase in anterior laxity following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in vivo?,Smith C.K.; Hull M.L.; Howell S.M.,2010,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.4001027,"A millimeter-for-millimeter relation between an increase in length of an anterior cruciate ligament graft construct and an increase in anterior laxity has been demonstrated in multiple in vitro studies. Based on this relation, a 3 mm increase in length of the graft construct following surgery could manifest as a 3 mm increase in anterior laxity in vivo, which is considered clinically unstable. Hence, the two primary objectives were to determine whether the millimeter-for-millimeter relation exists in vivo for slippage-resistant fixation of a soft-tissue graft and, if it does not exist, then to what extent the increase in stiffness caused by biologic healing of the graft to the bone tunnel offsets the potential increase in anterior laxity resulting from lengthening at the sites of fixation. Sixteen subjects were treated with a fresh-frozen, nonirradiated, nonchemically processed tibialis allograft. Tantalum markers were injected into the graft, fixation devices, and bones. On the day of surgery and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months, Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis was used to compute anterior laxity at 150 N of anterior force and the total slippage from both sites of fixation. A simple linear regression was performed to determine whether the millimeter-for-millimeter relation existed and a springs-in-series model of the graft construct was used to determine the extent to which the increase in stiffness caused by biological healing of the graft to the bone tunnel offset the increase in anterior laxity resulting from lengthening at the sites of fixation. There was no correlation between lengthening at the sites of fixation and the increase in anterior laxity at 1 month (R2 = 0.0, slope = 0.2). Also, the increase in stiffness of the graft construct caused by biologic healing of the graft to the bone tunnel offset 0.7 mm of the 1.5 mm potential increase in anterior laxity resulting from lengthening at the sites of fixation. This relatively large offset of nearly 50% occurred because lengthening at the sites of fixation was small.

A finite element (FE) simulation-based method was developed in this study that can automatically optimize the injection pattern of the polymeric ""inclusions"" according to a specific objective function, using commercially available software tools. The FE preprocessor TRUEGRID® was used to create a parametric axisymmetric LV mesh matched to experimentally measured end-diastole and end-systole metrics from dogs with coronary microembolization-induced heart failure.

Stress wave emission and cavitation bubble dynamics by nanosecond optical breakdown in a tissue phantom,Brujan E.-A.; Vogel A.,2006,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,10.1017/S0022112006000115,"Stress wave emission and cavitation bubble dynamics after optical breakdown in water and a tissue phantom with Nd: YAG laser pulses of 6 ns duration were investigated both experimentally and numerically to obtain a better understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in plasma-mediated laser surgery. Experimental tools were high-speed photography with 50 000 frames s-1, and acoustic measurements. The tissue phantom consisted of a transparent polyacrylamide (PAA) gel, the elastic properties of which can be controlled by modifying the water content. Breakdown in water produced a purely compressive stress wave. By contrast, in stiff PAA samples and for sufficiently large pulse energies, the compression wave was followed by an intense tensile wave, similar to the behaviour previously observed in cornea. The elastic/plastic response of the medium led to a significant decrease of the maximum size of the cavitation bubble and to a shortening of its oscillation period which was found to be related to the generation of the tensile stress wave upon breakdown. For increasing elastic modulus of the PAA, both the amplitudes of the bubble oscillation and of the stress wave emitted during bubble collapse decreased until the bubble oscillation was so strongly damped that no collapse stress wave was emitted. Numerical simulations were performed using a spherical model of bubble dynamics which includes the compressibility and elastic/plastic behaviour of the medium, viscosity, density and surface tension. The calculations revealed that consideration of the elastic/plastic behaviour of the medium surrounding the bubble is essential to describe the experimentally observed bipolar shape of the stress wave emitted upon optical breakdown. Water is a poor tissue model because the shape of the emitted stress waves and the bubble dynamics differ strongly for both materials. The mechanical properties of PAA were also found to be quite different from those of tissues. Experimental and numerical results provided evidence that the dynamic mechanical properties relevant for optical breakdown in PAA and tissue differ by as much as two orders of magnitude from the static values. The discovery of a tensile stress wave after optical breakdown in tissue-like media is of great importance for the assessment of collateral damage in laser surgery because biological tissues are much more susceptible to tensile stress than to compressive stress. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.",FALSE,
Computer-assisted zygoma reconstruction with vascularized iliac crest bone graft,Modabber A.; Gerressen M.; Ayoub N.; Elvers D.; Stromps J.-P.; Riediger D.; Hölzle F.; Ghassemi A.,2013,International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery,10.1002/rcs.1557,"Background: The reconstruction of zygoma is a challenge with regard to aesthetic and reconstructive demands. Methods: Pre-operative CT data were imported into specific surgical planning software. The mirror-imaging technique was used. A surgical guide transferred the virtual surgery plan to the operation site, whereby it fitted uniquely to the iliac donor site. A postoperative CT scan was obtained for comparing the actual postoperative graft position and shape with the pre-operative virtual simulation. Results: A mean difference of 0.71 mm (SD±1.42) for the shape analysis and 3.53 mm (SD±3.14) for the graft position was determined. The calculation of the closest point distance showed a surface deviation of<2 mm for the shape analysis with 83.6% of values and for the graft position with 35.7% of values.

Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks,"Isola, Phillip and Zhu, Jun-Yan and Zhou, Tinghui and Efros, Alexei A",2017,,,"Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs.

Previous studies show relative reproducibility of guidewire position after insertion, indicating that the guidewire position is constrained and could be represented by an energy minimization approach. Such representation would support the surgeon's decision process in guidewire selection. Methods: In this paper, we determine the guidewire position using a k-level graph based on 3D vessel information. Guidewire properties are incorporated into the graph as edge weights given by the local bending energy related to the local bending angle. The optimal path through this weighted directed graph is determined using a shortest path algorithm. Volumetric data of two different internal carotid artery phantoms (Ø 3.5-4.6 mm) was acquired. Two guidewires (Ø 0.33 mm) of different material properties (stainless steel, plastic-coated steel core) were inserted into the phantoms. Results: The average RMS distance between actual and simulated guidewire positions varies from 0.9 mm (plastic coated) to 1.3 mm (stainless steel); the computation time to determine the position was <2s. Conclusions: The results indicate that the proposed technique yields reproducible and accurate guidewire positions within a short, clinically relevant time frame.

Reconstruction of 3D human facial images using partial differential equations,Elyan E.; Ugail H.,2007,Journal of Computers,10.4304/jcp.2.8.1-8,"One of the challenging problems in geometric modeling and computer graphics is the construction of realistic human facial geometry. Such geometry are essential for a wide range of applications, such as 3D face recognition, virtual reality applications, facial expression simulation and computer based plastic surgery application. This paper addresses a method for the construction of 3D geometry of human faces based on the use of Elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDE). Here the geometry corresponding to a human face is treated as a set of surface patches, whereby each surface patch is represented using four boundary curves in the 3-space that formulate the appropriate boundary conditions for the chosen PDE. These boundary curves are extracted automatically using 3D data of human faces obtained using a 3D scanner. The solution of the PDE generates a continuous single surface patch describing the geometry of the original scanned data. In this study, through a number of experimental verifications we have shown the efficiency of the PDE based method for 3D facial surface reconstruction using scan data.

Laser transport through thin scattering layers,Eze R.; Kumar S.,2010,Applied Optics,10.1364/AO.49.000358,"Many modern applications of lasers involve understanding the transport of radiation through thin layers. The interactions of continuous wave and pulsed lasers with skin in dermatological use related to surgery and cosmetic procedures are examples of such. These highly scattering thin layers in skin are best modeled by the Monte Carlo method. However, most traditional Monte Carlo models may inaccurately account for the presence of thin layers. As an example, the very thin epidermis, with its highly absorbing melanin, is known to influence the laser penetration significantly. If the Monte Carlo model is implemented without special features, then the results of the simulation will show incorrect effects of thin layers because the path length of most photons would be significantly larger than the layer thickness. As a result, the computed photon travel path length would simply not feel the presence of the layer. In this paper, we present numerical and algorithmic features for computation of radiation transport through thin layers. It is noted that, while Monte Carlo without special features smears the radiative effect of the layers, the refined technique indicates that layers have a great impact on the absorption of energy, especially if the layer properties are distinctly different from those of the adjacent layers.

Development and validation methodology of the Nuss procedure surgical planner,Rechowicz K.J.; McKenzie F.D.,2013,SIMULATION,10.1177/0037549713496153,"Surgical planners are used to achieve the optimal outcome for surgery. They are especially desired in procedures where a positive aesthetic outcome is the primary goal, such as the Nuss procedure which is a minimally invasive surgery for correcting pectus excavatum (PE) – a congenital chest wall deformity which is characterized by a deep depression of the sternum. The Nuss procedure consists of placement of a metal bar(s) underneath the sternum, thereby forcibly changing the geometry of the ribcage. Because of the prevalence of PE and the popularity of the Nuss procedure, the demand to perform this surgery is greater than ever. Therefore, a Nuss procedure surgical planner is an invaluable planning tool ensuring an optimal physiological and aesthetic outcome. We propose the development and validation of the Nuss procedure planner. First, a generic model of the ribcage is developed. Then, the computed tomography (CT) data collected from actual patients with PE is used to create a set of patient-specific finite element models (FEM). Based on finite element analyses (FEA) a force–displacement data set is created. This data is used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to generalize the data set. In order to evaluate the planning process, a methodology which uses an average shape of the chest for comparison with results of the Nuss procedure planner is developed.

Although adding more screws to the construct will normally result in improved fixation stability, several issues need to be considered. Past reports have suggested that increasing the number of screws can result in the increase in spinal rigidity, decreased spine mobility, loss of bone and, possibly, screw loosening. In order to overcome this, options to have constrained, semi-constrained or hybrid screw and plate systems were later introduced. The purpose of this study is to compare the stability achieved by four and two screws using different plate systems after one-level corpectomy with placement of cage. A three-dimensional finite-element model of an intact C1-C7 segment was developed from computer tomography data sets, including the cortical bone, soft tissue and simulated corpectomy fusion at C4-C5. A spinal cage and an anterior cervical plate with different numbers of screws and plate systems were constructed to a fit one-level corpectomy of C5. Moment load of 1.0 N m was applied to the superior surface of C1, with C7 was fixed in all degrees of freedom. The kinematic stability of a two-screw plate was found to be statistically equivalent to a four-screw plate for one-level corpectomy. Thus, it can be a better option of fusion and infers comparable stability after one-level anterior cervical corpectomy, instead of a four-screw plate.© IMechE 2014.",TRUE,"Focuses on spine fixation mechanics instead of using AI to predict or evaluate aesthetic results in plastic or cancer-related surgery, so it doesn’t fit the review’s topic."
Optical properties of dental restorative materials in the wavelength range 400 to 700 nm for the simulation of color perception,Friebel M.; Povel K.; Cappius H.-J.; Helfmann J.; Meinke M.,2009,Journal of Biomedical Optics,10.1117/1.3250292,"Aesthetic restorations require dental restorative materials to have optical properties very similar to those of the teeth. A method is developed to this end to determine the optical parameters absorption coefficient μa, scattering coefficient μs, anisotropy factor g, and effective scattering coefficient μ's of dental restorative materials.

Finite element analysis of barbed sutures in skin and tendon tissues,Ingle N.P.; King M.W.; Zikry M.A.,2010,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.11.012,"Barbed surgical sutures are a new type of knotless suture that are currently being used clinically in cosmetic and plastic surgery procedures for faster healing and better cosmesis. Clinical studies are also underway to evaluate their performance in other deep tissue applications. However, little is known about their intrinsic mechanical behavior and their interactions with surrounding tissues. The primary objective of the current study was to analyze the mechanical behavior of barbed sutures using a finite element analysis approach. First, the effect of applying a point-pressure load to the tip of the barb and measuring its effect on barb displacement was studied. Second, the effect of an applied displacement to a barb anchored either in skin or tendon material for both the suture and the surrounding tissue. The results indicate that the flexibility of the barb can be increased or decreased by changing the barb geometry. It was concluded that the barb geometry and design need to be modified for use with different types of tissue. For example, in order to achieve the best mechanical anchoring with skin tissue the barb should be more flexible compared to the one designed to work with tendon tissue. The uniqueness of this study is that it is the first to establish a virtual prototyping and designing method for barbed sutures. For example, a new and improved virtual design of barb geometry is proposed and validated.

How to qualify and validate wear simulation devices and methods,Heintze S.D.,2006,Dental Materials,10.1016/j.dental.2006.02.002,"The clinical significance of increased wear can mainly be attributed to impaired aesthetic appearance and/or functional restrictions. Little is known about the systemic effects of swallowed or inhaled worn particles that derive from restorations. As wear measurements in vivo are complicated and time-consuming, wear simulation devices and methods had been developed without, however, systematically looking at the factors that influence important wear parameters. Wear simulation devices shall simulate processes that occur in the oral cavity during mastication, namely force, force profile, contact time, sliding movement, clearance of worn material, etc. Different devices that use different force actuator principles are available. Those with the highest citation frequency in the literature are - in descending order - the Alabama, ACTA, OHSU, Zurich and MTS wear simulators. When following the FDA guidelines on good laboratory practice (GLP) only the expensive MTS wear simulator is a qualified machine to test wear in vitro; the force exerted by the hydraulic actuator is controlled and regulated during all movements of the stylus. All the other simulators lack control and regulation of force development during dynamic loading of the flat specimens. This may be an explanation for the high coefficient of variation of the results in some wear simulators (28-40%) and the poor reproducibility of wear results if dental databases are searched for wear results of specific dental materials (difference of 22-72% for the same material). As most of the machines are not qualifiable, wear methods applying the machine may have a sound concept but cannot be validated. Only with the MTS method have wear parameters and influencing factors been documented and verified. A good compromise with regard to costs, practicability and robustness is the Willytec chewing simulator, which uses weights as force actuator and step motors for vertical and lateral movements. The Ivoclar wear method run on the Willytec machine shows a mean coefficient of variation in vertical wear of 12%. Force measurements have revealed that in the beginning of the stylus/specimen contact phase the force impulse is 3-4 times higher during dynamic loading than during static loading. When correlating material properties to the wear results of 23 composite resins subjected to the Ivoclar method, some parameters could be identified and incorporated into a wear formula to predict wear with the Ivoclar method. A round robin test evaluating the wear of ten dental materials with five wear simulation methods showed that the results were not comparable, as all methods follow different wear testing concepts. All wear methods lack the evidence of their clinical relevance because prospective studies correlating in vitro with long-term in vivo results with identical materials are not available. For direct restorative materials, amalgam seems to be a realistic reference material. For indirect, namely crown and bridge materials, low strength ceramic is appropriate. © 2006 Academy of Dental Materials.",FALSE,

From this perspective, a method is proposed, based on a technique called the mesh-matching method, followed by a process that corrects mesh irregularities. The meshmatching algorithm generates patient-specific volume meshes from an existing generic model. The mesh regularization process is based on the Jacobian matrix transform related to the FE reference element and the current element. This method for generating patient-specific FE models is first applied to computer-assisted maxillofacial surgery, and more precisely, to the FE elastic modelling of patient facial soft tissues. For each patient, the planned bone osteotomies (mandible, maxilla, chin) are used as boundary conditions to deform the FE face model, in order to predict the aesthetic outcome of the surgery. Seven FE patientspecific models were successfully generated by our method. For one patient, the prediction of the FE model is qualitatively compared with the patient's post-operative appearance, measured from a computer tomography scan. Then, our methodology is applied to computer-assisted orbital surgery. It is, therefore, evaluated for the generation of 11 patient-specific FE poroelastic models of the orbital soft tissues. These models are used to predict the consequences of the surgical decompression of the orbit. More precisely, an average law is extrapolated from the simulations carried out for each patient model.

A common symptom of the chronic stage is penile deformity during erection, which is frequently associated with pain and erectile dysfunction. A two-dimensional biomechanical model of the penis was applied to study the development of Peyronie's disease by simulating the mechanical stress distribution which would result from the interaction of the ossified tunical tissue with other penile soft tissues. The model was solved by using commercial finite element software for a characteristic erectile pressure. The results demonstrate that Peyronie's plaques may induce intensified stresses around the penile nerves and blood vessels, up to double those in the normal penis. These elevated stresses may cause a painful sensation of neural origin or ischemia in regions of compressed vascular tissue.

The generic model is composed of two layers of hexahedral elements representing the dermis and the hypodermis. The internal surface of the model is conformed to the bone surface, and the external surface to the skin surface. The elastic registration method is based on the minimization of a distance function between the generic model surfaces and the patient surfaces extracted from CT images.

Mitral valve flattening and parameter mapping for patient-specific valve diagnosis,Lichtenberg N.; Eulzer P.; Romano G.; Brčić A.; Karck M.; Lawonn K.; De Simone R.; Engelhardt S.,2020,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,Springer,"Purpose: Mitral valve (MV) disease is a common heart valve disease that can lead to heart failure. Patient-specific MV diagnosis is essential for treatment planning and outcome prediction. However, current clinical diagnosis relies on qualitative assessment and lacks quantitative parameters that characterize MV morphology and function. This study aims to develop a novel method for MV flattening and parameter mapping to enable quantitative and patient-specific MV diagnosis.  Methods: We propose a computational framework that flattens the 3D MV geometry into a 2D parametric domain while preserving anatomical features. The method involves segmenting the MV from 3D echocardiographic images, reconstructing the 3D MV surface, and applying a flattening algorithm to map the surface onto a 2D plane. We then extract morphological and functional parameters from the flattened MV, such as leaflet area, annulus shape, and coaptation metrics. The framework is validated on synthetic and clinical datasets.  Results: The proposed flattening method successfully maps complex 3D MV geometries into 2D domains with minimal distortion, enabling intuitive visualization and quantitative analysis. Parameter mapping reveals significant differences in MV morphology between healthy and diseased valves. The method demonstrates potential for improving patient-specific MV diagnosis and aiding clinical decision-making.  Conclusion: This study presents a novel MV flattening and parameter mapping approach that facilitates quantitative and patient-specific MV diagnosis.

The Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment cosmetic results (BCCT.core) software was developed to provide an objective and reproducible assessment of cosmetic outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the cosmetic outcomes of BCT using BCCT.core and to identify factors influencing these outcomes.  Materials and Methods: A total of 190 patients who underwent BCT were enrolled. Standardized photographs were taken at least 1 year after surgery. Cosmetic outcomes were assessed using BCCT.core software, which analyzes breast symmetry, color, and scar appearance. Clinical and treatment-related factors were analyzed to determine their association with cosmetic results.  Results: The BCCT.core scores classified cosmetic outcomes as excellent in 35.3%, good in 44.7%, fair in 15.3%, and poor in 4.7% of patients. Factors significantly associated with poorer cosmetic outcomes included larger tumor size, higher radiation dose, and presence of surgical complications. Multivariate analysis identified tumor size and radiation dose as independent predictors of cosmetic results.  Conclusion: BCCT.core provides an objective and reproducible method for evaluating cosmetic outcomes after BCT. Larger tumor size and higher radiation dose negatively impact cosmetic results.

Methods: A total of 100 patients who underwent BCT were included. Patients rated their aesthetic outcome using a visual analog scale (VAS). Objective measurements were performed using a computer-based system analyzing breast symmetry, volume, and nipple position. Correlations between subjective and objective assessments were analyzed.  Results: The mean patient VAS score was 7.2 (range 2–10). Objective measurements showed varying degrees of asymmetry. There was a moderate correlation between patient evaluations and objective symmetry measurements (r = 0.45, p < 0.01). However, some patients with significant asymmetry rated their results highly, indicating a discrepancy between subjective satisfaction and objective findings.  Conclusions: While objective measurements provide valuable information on aesthetic outcomes after BCT, they do not fully capture patients’ subjective satisfaction.
