Experimental and numerical analysis of innovative processes for producing a resorbable cheekbone prosthesis,Guglielmi P.; Cusanno A.; Bagudanch I.; Centeno G.; Ferrer I.; Garcia-Romeu M.L.; Palumbo G.,2021,Journal of Manufacturing Processes,10.1016/j.jmapro.2021.07.060,"Magnesium alloys have gained interest in biomedical applications due to the mechanical properties (very similar to the human bones) and the capability to be absorbed (additional surgery steps after the implantation not necessary). But suitable manufacturing techniques are required for these alloys, since the standard ones (machining, casting) or even the newest (additive) cannot be successfully adopted in every situation or cannot guarantee the requirements in terms of precision or cost. In the present paper two sheet forming processes (the Super Plastic Forming and the Incremental Sheet Forming) have been investigated for manufacturing a resorbable cheekbone implant using the Mg alloy AZ31B. An experimental/numerical approach was adopted: specific tests were conducted for determining the material behaviour to be implemented in the process simulations used for designing both the manufacturing processes; finally some prototypes of the investigated case study were produced and the post forming characteristics (thickness, roughness, accuracy) evaluated. Both the processes allowed to successfully and optimally produce the resorbable prosthesis adopted as case study, which revealed to be characterised by good enough surface quality (especially in the case of the Super Plastic Forming) and uniform thickness distribution (especially in the case of the Incremental Sheet Forming). © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",TRUE,"Focuses on manufacturing methods for cheekbone prostheses but doesn't cover automatic prediction or assessment of surgical aesthetics, so it doesn't fit the review's topic."

Eco-friendly synthesis of mesoporous bioactive glass ceramics and functionalization for drug delivery and hard tissue engineering applications,Tabassum S.; Saqib M.; Batool M.; Sharif F.; Gilani M.A.; Huck O.,2024,Biomedical Materials (Bristol),10.1088/1748-605X/ad2c19,"Hard tissue regenerative mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) has traditionally been synthesized using costly and toxic alkoxysilane agents and harsh conditions. In this study, MBG was synthesized using the cheaper reagent SiO2 by using a co-precipitation approach. The surface properties of MBG ceramic were tailored by functionalizing with amino and carboxylic groups, aiming to develop an efficient drug delivery system for treating bone infections occurring during or after reconstruction surgeries. The amino groups were introduced through a salinization reaction, while the carboxylate groups were added via a chain elongation reaction. The MBG, MBG-NH2, and MBG-NH-COOH were analyzed by using various techniques: x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The XRD results confirmed the successful preparation of MBG, and the FTIR results indicated successful functionalization. BET analysis revealed that the prepared samples were mesoporous, and functionalization tuned their surface area and surface properties. Cefixime, an antibiotic, was loaded onto MBG, MBG-NH2, and MBG-NH-COOH to test their drug-carrying capacity. Comparatively, MBG-NH-COOH showed good drug loading and sustained release behavior. The release of the drug followed the Fickian diffusion mechanism.

A comprehensive simulation framework for predicting the eCLIPs implant crimping into a catheter and its deployment mechanisms,Jahandardoost M.; Ricci D.; Milani A.S.; Jahandardoost M.; Grecov D.,2024,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2023.106227,"Tubular flow diverters (FDs) represent an important subset of the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms (CAs), acting to reduce aneurysm inflow, eventually resulting in aneurysm thrombosis and occlusion. eCLIPs (product of Evasc Neurovascular Enterprises, Vancouver, Canada), an innovative non-tubular implant causes flow diversion by bridging the neck of bifurcation CAs. However, in a small subset of challenging bifurcation aneurysms with fusiform pathology, the currently available eCLIPs models do not provide sufficient neck bridging resulting in a gap created between the device structure and the aneurysm/artery wall. To overcome this challenge, a new design of the eCLIPs (VR-eCLIPs) was developed by varying the rib length to cover such an inflow gap. To optimize the new product development process, and avoiding expensive and time-consuming iterative manufacture of prototype devices, we have developed a new finite element model to simulate the crimping and expansion processes of the VR-eCLIPs implant, and assess the possibility of plastic deformation. Results indicated that neither eCLIPs nor VR-eCLIPs experience plastic deformation during the crimping process. Upon full expansion, the ribs of VR-eCLIPs interact with the aneurysm and artery wall to cover the inflow gap that exists in certain challenging anatomies. This process serves as a basis to expedite design development prior to prototype manufacturing. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Focuses on mechanical simulation of a neurovascular implant, which doesn’t connect to predicting or assessing aesthetic results in plastic and cancer-related surgeries."
Design and development of model eye for retina laser by using additive manufacturing,Pugalendhi A.; Ranganathan R.; Venkatapathy N.; Narendran K.; Shah P.K.,2021,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine",10.1177/0954411920960548,"Surgical skill of the surgeon can be improved by surgical simulation. Especially in ophthalmology, it is impossible to use real human/non-human primate eyes for ophthalmology surgery practice. However, surgical practice is most important for ophthalmologist. The retina laser surgery is one of the ophthalmology surgeries and it requires more surgical practice for surgeons to use the laser beam precisely to coagulate and fuse small areas of tissue. Dealing with the prospect of vision reduction or vision loss presents a peculiar problem and that can be highly stressful and frustrating for both doctors and patients. In this regard, training for indirect ophthalmoscopy and retinal photocoagulation is undergone using model eyes instead of real eyes. Properties and functioning of an existing model eye are huge and they differ from real human eye such as casings are completely rigid and focusing of retinal fundus is not completely covered. Therefore, this research concentrates to develop a model eye that assimilates close to the human eye by focussing on the maximum viewing area that is not done at the moment. Finally, the design and development of re-engineered model eye for retina laser is fabricated by additive manufacturing. Compared to existing plastic model eye, viewing area and viewing angle of the re-engineered model eye is increased by 16.66% and 6.14%, respectively. Due to design modifications and elimination of the insert, it can be reduced by 18.99% and 13.95% of height and weight of the top casing respectively. Developed re-engineered model eye will improve the surgical and diagnostic skill of the surgeon and increase their confidence and proficiency.

Analysis of In Vivo Skin Anisotropy Using Elastic Wave Measurements and Bayesian Modelling,Nagle M.; Price S.; Trotta A.; Destrade M.; Fop M.; Ní Annaidh A.,2023,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10439-023-03185-2,"In vivo skin exhibits viscoelastic, hyper-elastic and non-linear characteristics. It is under a constant state of non-equibiaxial tension in its natural configuration and is reinforced with oriented collagen fibers, which gives rise to anisotropic behaviour. Understanding the complex mechanical behaviour of skin has relevance across many sectors including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and surgery. However, there is a dearth of quality data characterizing the anisotropy of human skin in vivo. The data available in the literature is usually confined to limited population groups and/or limited angular resolution. Here, we used the speed of elastic waves travelling through the skin to obtain measurements from 78 volunteers ranging in age from 3 to 93 years old. Using a Bayesian framework allowed us to analyse the effect that age, gender and level of skin tension have on the skin anisotropy and stiffness. First, we propose a new measurement of anisotropy based on the eccentricity of angular data and conclude that it is a more robust measurement when compared to the classic “anisotropic ratio”. Our analysis then concluded that in vivo skin anisotropy increases logarithmically with age, while the skin stiffness increases linearly along the direction of Langer Lines. We also concluded that the gender does not significantly affect the level of skin anisotropy, but it does affect the overall stiffness, with males having stiffer skin on average. Finally, we found that the level of skin tension significantly affects both the anisotropy and stiffness measurements employed here. This indicates that elastic wave measurements may have promising applications in the determination of in vivo skin tension. In contrast to earlier studies, these results represent a comprehensive assessment of the variation of skin anisotropy with age and gender using a sizeable dataset and robust modern statistical analysis. This data has implications for the planning of surgical procedures and questions the adoption of universal cosmetic surgery practices for very young or elderly patients. © 2023, The Author(s).",TRUE,"Focuses on measuring skin properties with elastic waves but doesn’t cover automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery, so it doesn’t fit the review’s focus."
Pilot Evaluation of Silicone Surrogates for Oral Mucosa Simulation in Craniofacial Surgical Training,Cin M.D.; Koka K.; Darragh J.; Nourmohammadi Z.; Hamdan U.; Zopf D.A.,2024,Biomimetics,10.3390/biomimetics9080464,"Surgical simulators are crucial in early craniofacial and plastic surgical training, necessitating synthetic materials that accurately replicate tissue properties. Recent critiques of our lab’s currently deployed silicone surrogate have highlighted numerous areas for improvement. To further refine our models, our group’s objective is to find a composition of materials that is closest in fidelity to native oral mucosa during surgical rehearsal by expert craniofacial surgeons. Fifteen platinum silicone-based surrogate samples were constructed with variable hardness and slacker percentages. These samples underwent evaluation of tactile sensation, hardness, needle puncture, cut resistance, suture retention, defect repair, and tensile elasticity. Expert craniofacial surgeon evaluators provided focused qualitative feedback on selected top-performing samples for further assessment and statistical comparisons. An evaluation revealed surrogate characteristics that were satisfactory and exhibited good performance. Sample 977 exhibited the highest performance, and comparison with the original surrogate (sample 810) demonstrated significant improvements in critical areas, emphasizing the efficacy of the refined composition. The study identified a silicone composition that directly addresses the feedback received by our team’s original silicone surrogate.

Computational mechanobiology model evaluating healing of postoperative cavities following breast-conserving surgery,Harbin Z.; Sohutskay D.; Vanderlaan E.; Fontaine M.; Mendenhall C.; Fisher C.; Voytik-Harbin S.; Tepole A.B.,2023,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107342,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer type worldwide. Given high survivorship, increased focus has been placed on long-term treatment outcomes and patient quality of life. While breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is the preferred treatment strategy for early-stage breast cancer, anticipated healing and breast deformation (cosmetic) outcomes weigh heavily on surgeon and patient selection between BCS and more aggressive mastectomy procedures. Unfortunately, surgical outcomes following BCS are difficult to predict, owing to the complexity of the tissue repair process and significant patient-to-patient variability. To overcome this challenge, we developed a predictive computational mechanobiological model that simulates breast healing and deformation following BCS. The coupled biochemical-biomechanical model incorporates multi-scale cell and tissue mechanics, including collagen deposition and remodeling, collagen-dependent cell migration and contractility, and tissue plastic deformation. Available human clinical data evaluating cavity contraction and histopathological data from an experimental porcine lumpectomy study were used for model calibration. The computational model was successfully fit to data by optimizing biochemical and mechanobiological parameters through Gaussian process surrogates. The calibrated model was then applied to define key mechanobiological parameters and relationships influencing healing and breast deformation outcomes. Variability in patient characteristics including cavity-to-breast volume percentage and breast composition were further evaluated to determine effects on cavity contraction and breast cosmetic outcomes, with simulation outcomes aligning well with previously reported human studies. The proposed model has the potential to assist surgeons and their patients in developing and discussing individualized treatment plans that lead to more satisfying post-surgical outcomes and improved quality of life. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Focuses on simulating tissue healing with computational models instead of using image analysis or AI to predict or evaluate aesthetic results, which doesn’t match the review’s focus."

This is due to the three-dimensional loss of bone, which limits the possibility for accurate anatomic reduction. Virtual surgery planning (VSP) can provide improved accuracy and shorter operating times, but is often not employed for trauma cases because of time constraints and complex user interfaces limited to two-dimensional interaction with three-dimensional data. Methods: In this study, we evaluate the accuracy, precision, and time efficiency of the haptic assisted surgery planning system (HASP), an in-house VSP system that supports stereo graphics, six degrees-of-freedom input, and haptics to improve the surgical planning. Three operators performed planning in HASP on computed tomography (CT) and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of a plastic skull model and on twelve retrospective cases with complex mandible fractures. Results: The results show an accuracy and reproducibility of less than 2 mm when using HASP for virtual fracture reduction, with an average planning time of 15 min including time for segmentation in the software BoneSplit.

Customized reconstructive prosthesis design based on topological optimization to treat severe proximal tibia defect,Zhang A.; Chen H.; Liu Y.; Wu N.; Chen B.; Zhao X.; Han Q.; Wang J.,2021,Bio-Design and Manufacturing,10.1007/s42242-020-00102-7,"A novel reconstructive prosthesis was designed with topological optimization (TO) and a lattice structure to enhance biomechanical and biological properties in the proximal tibia. The biomechanical performance was validated through finite element analysis (FEA) and biomechanical tests. The tibia with inhomogeneous material properties was reconstructed according to computed tomography images, and different components were designed to simulate the operation. Minimum compliance TO subject to a volume fraction constraint combined with a graded lattice structure was utilized to redesign the prosthesis. FEA was performed to evaluate the mechanical performances of the tibia and implants after optimization, including stress, micromotion, and strain energy. The results were analyzed by paired-samples t tests, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Biomechanical testing was used to verify the tibial stresses. Compared to the original group (OG), the TO group (TOG) exhibited lower stress on the stem, and the maximum von Mises stresses were 87.2 and 53.1 MPa, respectively, a 39.1% reduction (p < 0.05). Conversely, the stress and strain energy on the tibia increased in the TOG. The maximum von Mises stress values were 16.4 MPa in the OG and 22.9 MPa in the TOG with a 39.6% increase (p < 0.05), and the maximum SED value was 0.026 MPa in the OG and 0.042 MPa in the TOG, corresponding to an increase of 61.5% (p < 0.05). The maximum micromotions in the distal end of the stem were 135 μm in the OG and 68 μm in the TOG, almost a 50% reduction.

Data-driven tissue mechanics with polyconvex neural ordinary differential equations,Tac V.; Sahli Costabal F.; Tepole A.B.,2022,Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering,10.1016/j.cma.2022.115248,"Data-driven methods are becoming an essential part of computational mechanics due to their advantages over traditional material modeling. Deep neural networks are able to learn complex material response without the constraints of closed-form models. However, data-driven approaches do not a priori satisfy physics-based mathematical requirements such as polyconvexity, a condition needed for the existence of minimizers for boundary value problems in elasticity. In this study, we use a recent class of neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), to develop data-driven material models that automatically satisfy polyconvexity of the strain energy. We take advantage of the properties of ordinary differential equations to create monotonic functions that approximate the derivatives of the strain energy with respect to deformation invariants. The monotonicity of the derivatives guarantees the convexity of the energy. The N-ODE material model is able to capture synthetic data generated from closed-form material models, and it outperforms conventional models when tested against experimental data on skin, a highly nonlinear and anisotropic material. We also showcase the use of the N-ODE material model in finite element simulations of reconstructive surgery. The framework is general and can be used to model a large class of materials, especially biological soft tissues. We therefore expect our methodology to further enable data-driven methods in computational mechanics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",TRUE,"Focuses on creating material models for tissue mechanics instead of predicting or evaluating how plastic or oncological surgery looks, so it doesn’t fit the review’s topic."
In silico comparative biomechanical analysis of oblique and chevron medial displacement calcaneal osteotomies for pes planus deformity,Subasi O.; Sharma S.; Karaismailoglu B.; Hresko A.; Waryasz G.; Ashkani-Esfahani S.; Bejarano-Pineda L.,2024,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.107945,"Background: Medializing displacement calcaneal osteotomy is commonly performed as part of reconstructive surgery for patients with valgus hindfoot and progressive pes planus deformity. Among several types of calcaneal osteotomies, the oblique and Chevron osteotomy patterns have been commonly described in the literature and gained popularity as they are easily reproducible through percutaneous techniques. Currently, there is scarce evidence in the literature on which cut pattern is superior in terms of stability. To investigate the impact of cut pattern and posterior fragment medialization level on foot biomechanics, computational methods are employed. Methods: Ankle weightbearing computer tomography (CT) scans of seven patients diagnosed with stage II pes planus deformity are segmented and converted into 3D computational models. Oblique and Chevron osteotomy patterns are modeled independently for each patient. The posterior fragments are medially translated by 8-, 10- and 12-mm and subsequently fixated to the anterior calcaneus with two screws. A total of 42 models are exported to finite element software for biomechanical simulations. Among the investigated parameters, the higher stiffness and lower von Mises stress at the osteotomy interface and the screw site are assumed to be precursors of better stability. Results: It is recorded that as the medialization level increases, the stiffness decreases, and overall stresses increase. Also, it is observed that the Chevron cut produces a stiffer construct while the overall stresses are lower, indicating better stability when compared to the oblique cut. The statistical comparisons of the relevant groups that support these trends are found to be significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Chevron osteotomy showed superior stability compared to the oblique osteotomy while underscoring the negative impact of increased medialization of the posterior fragment. Clinical relevance: Opting for a lower medialization level and implementing the Chevron technique may facilitate union and earlier weightbearing. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical analysis of foot deformity surgeries and doesn't cover automatic prediction or aesthetic evaluation in plastic or cancer-related surgeries, so it falls outside the review’s focus."
Improving reconstructive surgery design using Gaussian process surrogates to capture material behavior uncertainty,Stowers C.; Lee T.; Bilionis I.; Gosain A.K.; Tepole A.B.,2021,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104340,"To produce functional, aesthetically natural results, reconstructive surgeries must be planned to minimize stress as excessive loads near wounds have been shown to produce pathological scarring and other complications (Gurtner et al., 2011). Presently, stress cannot easily be measured in the operating room. Consequently, surgeons rely on intuition and experience (Paul et al., 2016; Buchanan et al., 2016). Predictive computational tools are ideal candidates for surgery planning. Finite element (FE) simulations have shown promise in predicting stress fields on large skin patches and in complex cases, helping to identify potential regions of complication. Unfortunately, these simulations are computationally expensive and deterministic (Lee et al., 2018a). However, running a few, well selected FE simulations allows us to create Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models of local cutaneous flaps that are computationally efficient and able to predict stress and strain for arbitrary material parameters. Here, we create GP surrogates for the advancement, rotation, and transposition flaps. We then use the predictive capability of these surrogates to perform a global sensitivity analysis, ultimately showing that fiber direction has the most significant impact on strain field variations. We then perform an optimization to determine the optimal fiber direction for each flap for three different objectives driven by clinical guidelines (Leedy et al., 2005; Rohrer and Bhatia, 2005). While material properties are not controlled by the surgeon and are actually a source of uncertainty, the surgeon can in fact control the orientation of the flap with respect to the skin's relaxed tension lines, which are associated with the underlying fiber orientation (Borges, 1984). Therefore, fiber direction is the only material parameter that can be optimized clinically. The optimization task relies on the efficiency of the GP surrogates to calculate the expected cost of different strategies when the uncertainty of other material parameters is included. We propose optimal flap orientations for the three cost functions and that can help in reducing stress resulting from the surgery and ultimately reduce complications associated with excessive mechanical loading near wounds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"The abstract talks about using computer models to improve flap placement and lower mechanical stress in surgery but doesn’t cover predicting or assessing how things look afterward, so it doesn’t fit this review."

A taper-fit junction to improve long bone reconstruction: A parametric In Silico model,Schileo E.; Feltri P.; Taddei F.; di Settimi M.; Di Martino A.; Filardo G.,2021,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104790,"Purpose: Critical size long bone defects represent a clinical challenge in orthopaedic surgery. Various grafting techniques have been developed through the years, but they all present several downsides. A key requirement of all grafting techniques is the achievement of a continuous interface between host bone and graft to enhance both biological processes and mechanical stability. This study used a parametric in silico model to quantify the biomechanical effect of the inaccuracies inherent to current osteotomy techniques, and to test a new concept of accurate taper-fit junction that may improve the biomechanical parameters of the reconstruction under load. Methods: A population-based in-silico 3D model of the reconstruction of a long bone defect was built to represent a defect of the femoral mid-diaphysis. To fix the reconstruction a titanium plate was placed on the lateral aspect of the reconstruction. The model was modified to (i) quantify the biomechanical consequences of actual inaccuracies in the realization of a flat host-graft interface, (ii) compare the contact behaviour and bone strains among different taper angles of the new design and the current host-graft flat interface, (iii) evaluate the robustness of the taper-fit design to inter-subject variability in bone geometry and defect length. Results: The influence of 2° single-plane misalignments of the host-graft interface is highly dependent on the misalignment orientation with respect to the metal plate. For some misalignment orientations, tangential micromotions of contact interfaces exceeded alert thresholds. When the angle of the taper-fit host-graft junction is changed from 10° to 30° and the results obtained are compared with the planar case, the overall stiffness is almost preserved, the bone strains are almost unchanged with safety factors higher than five, and full contact closure around the host-graft junction is achieved at 20°. Similarly, contact pressures decrease almost linearly with a 20% decrease at 30°. The host-graft micro motions are almost unchanged in both value and distribution up to 20° and never exceed the warning threshold of 50 μm. Conclusions: The present in silico study developed quantitative biomechanical evidence that an osteotomy performed with attention to the perpendicularity of the cut planes is needed to reduce the risk of mismatch and possible complications of long bone reconstructions, and that a new concept of a taper-fit junction may improve the biomechanical environment of the interface between the graft and the host bone. The optimal taper-fit configuration is suggested to be around a 20° taper angle. These results will serve as an input to conduct ex vivo experiments to further corroborate the proposed taper-fit junction concept and to refine its surgical implementation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical modeling of bone reconstruction without covering automatic prediction or aesthetic evaluation in plastic or cancer surgery, which falls outside the review’s scope."
Evaluation of the usability of a low-cost 3D printer in a tissue engineering approach for external ear reconstruction,Kuhlmann C.; Blum J.C.; Schenck T.L.; Giunta R.E.; Wiggenhauser P.S.,2021,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,10.3390/ijms222111667,"The use of alloplastic materials instead of autologous cartilage grafts offers a new perspective in craniofacial reconstructive surgery. Particularly for regenerative approaches, customized implants enable the surgeon to restore the cartilaginous framework of the ear without donor site morbidity. However, high development and production costs of commercially available implants impede clinical translation. For this reason, the usability of a low-cost 3D printer (Ultimaker 2+) as an inhouse-production tool for cheap surgical implants was investigated. The open software architecture of the 3D printer was modified in order to enable printing of biocompatible and biologically degradable polycaprolactone (PCL). Firstly, the printing accuracy and limitations of a PCL implant were compared to reference materials acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). Then the self-made PCL-scaffold was seeded with adipose-tissue derived stem cells (ASCs), and biocompatibility was compared to a commercially available PCL-scaffold using a cell viability staining (FDA/PI) and a dsDNA quantification assay (PicoGreen). Secondly, porous and solid patient-customized ear constructs were manufactured from mirrored CT-imagining data using a computer-assisted design (CAD) and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAM) approach to evaluate printing accuracy and reproducibility. The results show that printing of a porous PCL scaffolds was possible, with an accuracy equivalent to the reference materials at an edge length of 10 mm and a pore size of 0.67 mm. Cell viability, adhesion, and proliferation of the ASCs were equivalent on self-made and the commercially available PCL-scaffolds. Patient-customized ear constructs could be produced well in solid form and with limited accuracy in porous form from all three thermoplastic materials. Printing dimensions and quality of the modified low-cost 3D printer are sufficient for selected tissue engineering applications, and the manufacturing of personalized ear models for surgical simulation at manufacturing costs of EUR 0.04 per cell culture scaffold and EUR 0.90 (0.56) per solid (porous) ear construct made from PCL.

Monosaccharide-mediated rational synthesis of a universal plasmonic platform with broad spectral fluorescence enhancement for high-sensitivity cancer biomarker analysis,Liu M.; Li Y.; Xing W.; Zhang Y.; Xie X.; Pang J.; Zhou F.; Yang J.,2022,Journal of Nanobiotechnology,10.1186/s12951-022-01359-z,"Background: Effective and accurate screening of oncological biomarkers in peripheral blood circulation plays an increasingly vital role in diagnosis and prognosis. High-sensitivity assays can effectively aid clinical decision-making and intervene in cancer in a localized status before they metastasize and become unmanageable. Meanwhile, it is equally pivotal to prevent overdiagnosis of non-life-threatening cancer by eliminating unnecessary treatment and repeated blood draws. Unfortunately, current clinical screening methodologies can hardly simultaneously attain sufficient sensitivity and specificity, especially under resource-restrained circumstances. To circumvent such limitations, particularly for cancer biomarkers from early-onset and recurrence, we aim to develop a universal plasmonic platform for clinical applications, which macroscopically amplifies multiplexed fluorescence signals in a broad spectral window and readily adapts to current assay setups without sophisticated accessories or expertise at low cost. Methods: The plasmonic substrate was chemically synthesized in situ at the solid–liquid interface by rationally screening a panel of reducing monosaccharides and tuning the redox reactions at various catalyst densities and precursor concentrations. The redox properties were studied by Benedict’s assay and electrochemistry. We systemically characterized the morphologies and optical properties of the engineered plasmonic Ag structures by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectroscopy. The structure-fluorescence enhancement correlation was explicitly explained by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and a computational model for gap distribution. Next, we established an enhanced fluoroimmunoassay (eFIA) using a model biomarker for prostate cancer (PCa) and validated it in healthy and PCa cohorts. Prognosis was explored in patients subject to surgical and hormonal interventions following recommended PCa guidelines. Results: The monosaccharide-mediated redox reaction yielded a broad category of Ag structures, including sparsely dispersed nanoparticles (NPs) of various sizes, semi-continuous nanoislands, and crackless continuous films. Optimal broad-spectral fluorescence enhancement from green to far-red was observed for the inhomogeneous, irregularly-shaped semi-continuous Ag nanoisland substrate (AgNIS), synthesized from a well-balanced redox reaction at a stable rate mediated by mannose. In addition, different local electric field intensity distributions in response to various incident excitations were observed at the nanoscale, elucidating the need for irregular and inhomogeneous structures. AgNIS enabled a maximized 54.7-fold macroscopically amplified fluorescence and long-lasting photostability. Point-of-care availability was fulfilled using a customized smartphone prototype with well-paired optics. The eFIA effectively detected the PCa marker in cell lines, xenograft tumors, and patient sera. The plasmonic platform rendered a diagnostic sensitivity of 86.0% and a specificity of 94.7% and capably staged high-grade PCa that the clinical gold standard test failed to stratify. Patient prognosis of robotic-assisted surgeries and hormone therapies was non-invasively monitored following efficient medical interventions. The assay time was significantly curtailed on the plasmonic platform upon microwave irradiation. Conclusions: By investigating the effects of reducing monosaccharides on the seed-mediated chemical synthesis of plasmonic Ag structures, we deduced that potent multiplexed fluorescence enhancement originated from both an adequate reducing power and a steady reduction rate. Furthermore, the inhomogeneous structure with adequate medium gap distances afforded optimal multiwavelength fluorescence enhancement, thus empowering an effective eFIA for PCa. The clinically validated diagnostic and prognostic features, along with the low sample volume, point-of-care feasibility with a smartphone, and microwave-shortened assay time, warrant its potential clinical translation for widespread cancer biomarker analysis.",TRUE,"Focuses on developing a cancer biomarker detection tool, but doesn’t cover automatic prediction or assessment of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer-related surgery, so it doesn’t match the review’s topic."
Influence of Prestretch on Planar Indentation of Elastomers: Insights from Experiments and Theory,Wu S.; Zheng Y.L.,2025,Journal of Applied Mechanics,10.1115/1.4067149,"Elastomers exhibit a stiffer mechanical response and anisotropy when stretched in a specific direction, which has led to numerous applications in biomechanics, surgery, tactile sensors, and more. This study introduces a comprehensive, experimentally validated analytical framework to investigate the effects of prestretch on the planar contact between a rigid indenter and a hyperelastic substrate. By linearizing the equilibrium equation for incremental deformation, we adapt the superposition principle to reveal how prestretch modifies the mechanical response, which is reflected in a simple prefactor in the surface Green's function. This modification facilitates precise calculation of contact mechanics properties, including indentation pressure distributions and displacement profiles, which are essential for assessing both global and local properties, e.g., force-displacement responses. We further support our theoretical findings with numerical simulations and validate them through cylindrical indentation tests across various stretch ratios. These outcomes emphasize the feasibility of using our first-order approximation theory in practical settings, especially for the mechanical characterization of materials involving residual stress analysis and the development of advanced, model-based adaptive tactile sensors.

Bayesian calibration of a computational model of tissue expansion based on a porcine animal model,Han T.; Lee T.; Ledwon J.; Vaca E.; Turin S.; Kearney A.; Gosain A.K.; Tepole A.B.,2022,Acta Biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2021.10.007,"Tissue expansion is a technique used clinically to grow skin in situ to correct large defects. Despite its enormous potential, lack of fundamental knowledge of skin adaptation to mechanical cues, and lack of predictive computational models limit the broader adoption and efficacy of tissue expansion. In our previous work, we introduced a finite element model of tissue expansion that predicted key patterns of strain and growth which were then confirmed by our porcine animal model. Here we use the data from a new set of experiments to calibrate the computational model within a Bayesian framework. Four 10×10 cm2 patches were tattooed in the dorsal skin of four 12 weeks-old minipigs and a total of six patches underwent successful tissue expander placement and inflation to 60cc for expansion times ranging from 1 h to 7 days. Six patches that did not have expanders implanted served as controls for the analysis. We find that growth can be explained based on the elastic deformation. The predicted area growth rate is k∈[0.02,0.08] [h−1]. Growth is anisotropic and reflects the anisotropic mechanical behavior of porcine dorsal skin. The rostral-caudal axis shows greater deformation than the transverse axis, and the time scale of growth in the rostral-caudal direction is given by rate parameters k1∈[0.04,0.1] [h−1] compared to k2∈[0.01,0.05] [h−1] in the transverse direction. Moreover, the calibration results underscore the high variability in biological systems, and the need to create probabilistic computational models to predict tissue adaptation in realistic settings. Statement of significance: Tissue expansion is a widely used technique in reconstructive surgery because it triggers growth of skin for the correction of large skin lesions and for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Despite of its potential, complications and undesired outcomes persist due to our incomplete understanding of skin mechanobiology. Here we quantify the deformation and growth fields induced by an expander over 7 days in a porcine animal model and use these data to calibrate a computational model of skin growth using finite element simulations and a Bayesian framework. The calibrated model is a leap forward in our understanding skin growth, we now have quantitative understanding of this process: area growth is anisotropic and it is proportional to stretch with a characteristic rate constant of k∈[0.02,0.08] [h−1]. © 2021 Acta Materialia Inc.",TRUE,"Focuses on computer modeling in pigs without covering how to automatically predict or assess looks after human plastic or cancer surgery, so it doesn’t match the review’s goals."
Investigation of radiomic features on MRI images to identify extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer,Gumus K.Z.; Menendez M.; Baerga C.G.; Harmon I.; Kumar S.; Mete M.; Hernandez M.; Ozdemir S.; Yuruk N.; Balaji K.C.; Gopireddy D.R.,2025,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108528,"Background and Objective: Detection of extraprostatic extension (EPE) preoperatively is of critical importance in the context of prostate cancer (PCa) management and outcomes. This study aimed to characterize the radiomic features of malignant prostate lesions based on multi-paramagnetic magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Methods: We analyzed 20 patients who underwent mpMRI followed by radical prostatectomy. Two experienced radiologists manually segmented the 3D lesions using the T2-weighted (T2WI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) imaging sequences. A total of 210 radiomic features were extracted from each lesion. We used the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation to select key features. Using the selected radiomic features, we developed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify the EPE and non-EPE lesions. The pathology results were accepted as gold standard for EPE. We measured the performance of the classifier, calculating the area-under-curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Results: A total of 25 lesions were segmented, including 12 lesions with EPE and 13 lesions without EPE, based on the pathology reports. We selected 18 radiomic features (18/210).

In developing an adequate model to utilize in simulation, 3D printing has emerged as a useful technology to provide detailed, accessible, and high-fidelity models. Nasal osteotomy is an essential step in many rhinoplasty surgeries, yet it can be challenging to perform and difficult to receive adequate exposure to this nuanced portion of the procedure. As it currently stands, there are limited opportunities to practice nasal osteotomy due to the reliance on cadaveric bones, which are expensive, difficult to obtain, and require appropriate facilities and personnel. While previous designs have been developed, these models leave room for improvement in printing efficiency, cost, and material performance. This manuscript aims to describe the methodology for the design of an updated nasal osteotomy training model derived from anatomic data and optimized for printability, usability, and fidelity. Additionally, an analysis of multiple commercially available 3D printing materials and technologies was conducted to determine which offered superior equivalency to bone. Methods: This model was updated from a first-generation model previously described to include a more usable base and form, reduce irrelevant structures, and optimize geometry for 3D printing, while maintaining the nasal bones with added stabilizers essential for function and fidelity. For the material comparison, this updated model was printed in five materials: Ultimaker Polylactic Acid, 3D Printlife ALGA, 3DXTECH SimuBone, FibreTuff, and FormLabs Durable V2. Facial plastic surgeons tested the models in a blinded, randomized fashion and completed surveys assessing tactile feedback, audio feedback, material limitation, and overall value. Results: A model optimizing printability while maintaining quality in the area of interest was developed. In the material comparison, SimuBone emerged as the top choice amongst the evaluating physicians in an experience-based subjective comparison to human bone during a simulated osteotomy procedure using the updated model.

Preoperative design of flap based on computer-aided design technology: morphological flattening and analysis of three-dimensional wound,Ji X.; Luan Y.; Gong H.; Duan Y.; Zhang J.; Deng L.,2022,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1080/10255842.2021.2001461,"The shape of skin flaps is only described by swatches for preoperative design because of the irregular shape of skin wounds caused by trauma in the clinic. The method is rough, and the flaps cut often cannot match the wounds and affect their appearance. Computer-aided design technology helps to attain precise results in less time. This study proposes a skin wound morphological flattening algorithm based on hierarchical values. First, the skin wound is scanned by three-dimensional (3D) scanning technology to obtain a spatial mesh model consisting of triangular cells, and the mesh model is layered with a hierarchical value. Then, the layered mesh is topologically mapped to the plane. Subsequently, the stress and strain of the skin are simulated using a mechanical method, and the shape of the flattened skin wound is optimized layer by layer. Finally, the multiresolution smoothing technique is used to smooth the developed boundary contour and fit the curve to obtain a guidance plan for preoperative flap design. The results of the study showed that this method can accurately determine the shape of the skin wounds and quantitatively analyze the preoperative design results of the skin flaps. The average error of the area and edge length after flattening was reduced to less than 10%.

The effect of bone relaxation on the simulated pull-off force of a cementless femoral knee implant,Gersie T.; Bitter T.; Freeman R.; Verdonschot N.; Janssen D.,2025,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2025.112528,"Aseptic loosening is the primary cause of revision in cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA), emphasizing the importance of strong initial stability for long-term implant success. Pre-clinical evaluations are crucial for understanding implant fixation mechanics and improving implant designs. Finite element (FE) analysis models often use linear elastic bone material models, which do not accurately reflect bone's mechanical behavior. Incorporating a von Mises yield model to simulate bone's plastic behavior improved predictions of primary stability but tends to overestimate fixation, potentially due to neglecting bone viscoelasticity. Stress relaxation in bone can affect primary stability by reducing press-fit forces on implants. This study aimed to include bone relaxation into FE models of femoral TKA reconstructions to investigate the impact of bone material models on primary fixation. Simulated pull-off tests were conducted using three material models: elastic, plastic, and plastic-viscoelastic. Six femoral reconstructions, previously used in another study, were included. The average pull-off force decreased (about 79%) from 31 kN with the elastic model to 6.3 kN when bone plasticity was included. Introducing stress relaxation showed a minimal effect, leading to an additional reduction in pull-off force of 0.8%. A significant positive correlation was found between bone mineral density and pull-off force across the three material models. Additionally, elastic strain energy within the femur correlated strongly with pull-off force, suggesting higher strain energy increases pull-off force.

This study evaluated the impact of the design and composition of commercially available collagen-based matrices on the observed vacuum pressure delivered under NPWT using a custom test apparatus. Specifically, testing compared the effect of the commercial products; ovine forestomach matrix (OFM), collagen/oxidized regenerated cellulose (collagen/ORC) and a collagen-based dressing (CWD) on the observed vacuum pressure. OFM resulted in an ∼50% reduction in the observed target vacuum pressure at 75 mmHg and 125 mmHg, however, this effect was mitigated to a ∼0% reduction when fenestrations were introduced into the matrix. Both collagen/ORC and CWD reduced the observed vacuum pressure at 125 mmHg (∼15% and ∼50%, respectively), and this was more dramatic when a lower vacuum pressure of 75 mmHg was delivered (∼20% and ∼75%, respectively). The reduced performance of the reconstituted collagen products is thought to result from the gelling properties of these products that may cause occlusion of the delivered vacuum to the wound bed.

Experimental analysis and numerical fatigue life prediction of 3D-Printed osteosynthesis plates,Nakhaei M.; Sterba M.; Foletti J.-M.; Badih L.; Behr M.,2023,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2023.1133869,"The trend towards patient-specific medical orthopedic prostheses has led to an increased use of 3D-printed surgical implants made of Ti6Al4V. However, uncertainties arise due to varying printing parameters, particularly with regards to the fatigue limit. This necessitates time-consuming and costly experimental validation before they can be safely used on patients. To address this issue, this study aimed to employ a stress-life fatigue analysis approach coupled with a finite element (FE) simulation to estimate numerically the fatigue limit and location of failure for 3D-printed surgical osteosynthesis plates and to validate the results experimentally. However, predicting the fatigue life of 3D components is not a new concept and has previously been implemented in the medical device field, though without experimental validation. Then, an experimental fatigue test was conducted using a proposed modification to the staircase method introduced in ISO 12107. Additionally, a FE model was developed to estimate the stress cycles on the plate. The stress versus number of cycles to failure curve (S-N) obtained from the minimum mechanical properties of 3D-printed Ti6AI4V alloy according to ASTM F3001-14 to predict the fatigue limit. The comparison between experimental results and fatigue numerical predictions showed very good agreement. It was found that a linear elastic FE model was sufficient to estimate the fatigue limit, while an elastic-plastic model led to an accurate prediction throughout the implant’s cyclic life.

Il was shown that the tibia-IMN structure provided a bending resistant load up to three-times higher than the tibia-PL. In fact, the used screws for plate fixation induced a high level of stress in the vicinity of threaded region, leading to a crack initiation and a damage propagation. However, in tibia-IMN structure the highest stress was generated in the trapped zone between the loader and the nail, promoting crack formation.

In this phantom study, the feasibility of a noninvasive hybrid registration method is assessed. This method consists of a point registration with anatomic landmarks for initialization and a surface registration using the bare mandibular bone surface for optimization. Methods: Three mandible phantoms with reference notches on two osteotomy planes were 3D printed. An electromagnetic tracking system in combination with 3D Slicer software was used for navigation. Different configurations, i.e., different surface point areas and number and configuration of surface points, were tested with a dentate phantom (A) in a metal-free environment. To simulate the intraoperative environment and different anatomies, the registration procedure was also performed with an OR bed using the dentate phantom and two (partially) edentulous phantoms with atypical anatomy (B and C). The accuracy of the registration was calculated using the notches on the osteotomy planes and was expressed as the target registration error (TRE).

Comparison of the 3D-microstructure of human alveolar and fibula bone in microvascular autologous bone transplantation: a synchrotron radiation μ-CT study,Wüster J.; Hesse B.; Rothweiler R.; Bortel E.; Gross C.; Bakhtiyari S.; King A.; Boller E.; Gerber J.; Rendenbach C.; Fretwurst T.; Preissner S.; Heiland M.; Nelson K.; Nahles S.,2023,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2023.1169385,"Introduction: Autologous bone transplantation is successfully used in reconstructive surgery of large/critical-sized bone defects, whereby the microvascular free fibula flap is still regarded as the gold standard for the reconstruction of such defects in the head and neck region. Here, we report the morphological and lacunar properties of patient-paired bone samples from eight patients from the jaw (AB; recipient site) and the fibula (FB; donor site) on the micron length-scale using Synchrotron µ-CT. Insights into differences and similarities between these bone structures could offer a better understanding of the underlying mechanism for successful surgical outcomes and might clear the path for optimized, nature-inspired bone scaffold designs. Methods: Spatial vessel-pore arrangements, bone morphology, fluid-simulation derived permeability tensor, osteocyte lacunar density, and lacunar morphology are compared. Results: The orientation of the vessel system indicates a homogenous vessel orientation for AB and FB. The average mineral distance (50%) to the closest vessel boundary is higher in AB than in FB (the mean is 96 μm for AB vs. 76 μm for FB; p = 0.021). Average osteocyte lacunar density is found to be higher in AB than in FB (mean 22,874 mm3 vs. 19,376 mm3 for FB; p = 0.038), which might compensate for the high distance from the mineral to the nearest vessel. No significant differences in lacunar volume are found between paired AB and FB. Discussion: A comparable vessel network and similar distribution of vessel porosity between AB and FB may allow the FB graft to exhibit a high regeneration potential when connected to AB, and this might correlate with a high osteoinductive and osteoconductive potential of FB when connected to AB. Since widely used and potent synthetic bone grafts exist, new insight into the bone structure of well-established autologous bone grafts, such as the free fibula flap, could help to improve the performance of such materials and therefore the design of 3D scaffolds.

Genetic Algorithm-Based Optimization for the Geometric Design of a Novel Orthopedic Implant,You W.S.; Casebier J.; Mandich J.; Balasubramanian R.,2021,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2021.3080226,"Objective: A tendon-transfer is a reconstructive orthopedic surgery where tendons are re-routed from a non-functioning muscle and attached a functioning muscle. Prior work has shown that using a passive implanted device in the ECRL-to-FDP tendon-transfer surgery significantly improves hand grasping function. However, it is still unclear how hand-function improvement, measured by finger joint range of motion and torque, is dependent on the implant's geometry and location within the tendon network. This paper presents a genetic algorithm that determines the device's optimal geometry and location. Methods: Hand biomechanical simulation platform was developed to model hand function and also model the tendon-transfer surgery with and without the implant. Finger kinematics and joint torque were used to develop three unique objective functions to optimize the implant's parameters. Results: The optimized device resulted in an 11X increase in finger kinematics with only a 0.9% decrease in joint torque when compared with the biomechanical function enabled by the current suture-based surgery. Conclusion: Designing implantable devices that modify musculoskeletal function is challenging. Factors like tendon routing and joint kinematics create a complex nonlinear system when considering biomechanical function. A genetic algorithm is an effective tool to tackle these nonlinear landscapes to produce optimized designs. Significance: The state-of-the-art surgical procedure to repair high median-ulnar nerve palsy leads to poor hand function and severely limits the patient's ability to perform activities of daily life. This work provides a method for defining relevant objective functions for hand biomechanical function and then uses those objective functions with genetic algorithms to optimize the geometry of an orthopedic implant across multiple variables. The achieved biomechanical function is significantly better than hand function enabled by current surgical procedure.  © 1964-2012 IEEE.",TRUE,"Centers on improving implant design for hand function, but doesn’t cover automatic prediction or assessment of appearance in plastic or cancer-related surgeries, so it falls outside the review’s focus."
New Surgical Devices for Closed Reduction of Frontal Sinus Bone Fracture,Wi D.; Lee H.; Jeong W.S.; Choi J.; Moon Y.; Choi J.W.,2025,International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering,10.1002/cnm.70042,"Traditional surgical interventions for frontal sinus fractures necessitate a cut on the forehead skin, and extant closed reduction techniques aimed at enhancing accessibility continue to grapple with secure tool fixation, stable bone elevation, and screw breakage risk. To address these challenges and augment surgical efficiency, this study introduces novel surgical devices. Design parameters for models with spiral or L-shaped tips are established, considering practical medical requirements and constraints, and subsequently validated through finite element method numerical simulations using commercial software, Ansys. Four spiral-type prototypes are constructed, and three scenarios for each prototype, varying in projection distance from the device handle to the bone-device contact point, are examined via nonlinear simulation analyses. For the L-shaped type, three prototypes are developed, and static analyses are conducted for four scenarios per prototype, differing in traction force locations, based on another simulation result concerning moments of inertia calculation with a force boundary condition unlike pressure. Maximum stress results under a specific force are analyzed, and the maximum permissible force is determined under the most unfavorable force application condition. Simulation outcomes indicate that the spiral type offers greater applicability with less force to lift multiple bones, while the L-shaped type is more suitable under bone hardening conditions. © 2025 The Author(s).

Augmented reality simulation framework for minimally invasive orthopedic surgery,Cangelosi A.; Riberi G.; Titolo P.; Salvi M.; Molinari F.; Ulrich L.; Vezzetti E.; Agus M.; Calì C.,2025,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.109943,"Purpose: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has emerged in clinical practice to minimize surgical trauma, providing patients with faster recovery, reduced pain and complications and enhanced aesthetic results compared to traditional surgery. However, this approach increase the risk of iatrogenic damage, i.e. the accidental injury to sensitive anatomical structures (eg. nerves and vascular strcuteres) not directly visible during a percutaneous access. Augmented reality (AR) can effectively mitigate these drawbacks by overlaying graphical information onto the surgical field and providing real-time feedback, offering support in training settings and clinical practice. Implementation challenges have limited the number of case studies in the scientific literature. This study presents a novel simulation paradigm for orthopedic surgery training, filling a gap in surgical skill development resources for trainees, and demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach. Methods: The proposed methodology provides a framework for building a cost-effective and easily reproducible surgical training simulation environment. To address the challenge of mental spatial navigation during MIS procedures, the framework's rationale is to address the challenge of mental spatial navigation during MIS procedures. A surgical gesture tracking system using a commercial depth camera for comfortable simulation was developed. The principles of the acquisition system, image processing, and spatial computation mechanics are detailed to illustrate the framework's applicability. Digital environments customization with game engines to simulate expensive medical instrumentation, such as the C-arm, is also demonstrated. The simulation platform comprises a Computer Vision (CV) module, an X-ray machine simulation module, and an AR module. Results: System validation involved analysis at different framework levels. From texture analysis of acquired images to application accuracy evaluation, the influence of various parameters on system performance is demonstrated. The simulation system is a valuable tool for learning minimally invasive procedures and for developers building AR systems for medical applications. The implementation is focused on the insertion surgical devices, including screws and K-wires. This is results in real application in minimizing the risk of iatrogenic injury to neural and vascular structures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of highly reproducible accuracy between real and virtual environment an analysis of errors and accuracies is illustrated at level of different subsystems.

Exploring uncertainty in hyper-viscoelastic properties of scalp skin through patient-specific finite element models for reconstructive surgery,Song G.; Gosain A.K.; Buganza Tepole A.; Rhee K.; Lee T.,2025,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1080/10255842.2024.2313067,"Understanding skin responses to external forces is crucial for post-cutaneous flap wound healing. However, the in vivo viscoelastic behavior of scalp skin remains poorly understood. Personalized virtual surgery simulations offer a way to study tissue responses in relevant 3D geometries. Yet, anticipating wound risk remains challenging due to limited data on skin viscoelasticity, which hinders our ability to determine the interplay between wound size and stress levels. To bridge this gap, we reexamine three clinical cases involving scalp reconstruction using patient-specific geometric models and employ uncertainty quantification through a Monte Carlo simulation approach to study the effect of skin viscoelasticity on the final stress levels from reconstructive surgery. Utilizing the generalized Maxwell model via the Prony series, we can parameterize and efficiently sample a realistic range of viscoelastic response and thus shed light on the influence of viscoelastic material uncertainty in surgical scenarios.

Therapeutic Validation of Venous Pulsatile Tinnitus and Biomaterial Applications for Temporal Bone Reconstruction Surgery Using Multi-sensing Platforms and Coupled Computational Techniques,Hsieh Y.-L.; Gao X.; Wang X.; Hsiang F.-C.; Sun X.; Wang W.,2022,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2021.777648,"The application of grafts and biomaterials is a cardinal therapeutic procedure to resolve venous pulsatile tinnitus (PT) caused by temporal bone dehiscence during transtemporal reconstructive surgery. However, the transmission mechanism of venous PT remains unclear, and the sound absorption and insulation properties of different repair materials have not been specified. This study quantifies the vibroacoustic characteristics of PT, sources the major transmission pathway of PT, and verifies the therapeutic effect of different material applications using joint multi-sensing platforms and coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. The in vivo intraoperative acoustic and vibroacoustic characteristics of intrasinus blood flow motion and dehiscent sigmoid plate of a typical venous PT patient were investigated using acoustic and displacement sensors. The acoustical, morphological, and mechanical properties of the dehiscent sigmoid plate, grafts harvested from a cadaveric head, and other biomaterials were acquired using acoustical impedance tubes, micro-CT, scanning electron microscopy, and mercury porosimetry, as appropriate. To analyze the therapeutic effect of our previous reconstructive techniques, coupled CFD simulations were performed using the acquired mechanical properties of biomaterials and patient-specific radiologic data. The peak in vivo intraoperatively gauged, peak simulated vibroacoustic and peak simulated hydroacoustic amplitude of PT prior to sigmoid plate reconstruction were 64.0, 70.4, and 72.8 dB, respectively. After the solidified gelatin sponge–bone wax repair technique, the intraoperative gauged peak amplitude of PT was reduced from 64.0 to 47.3 dB. Among three different reconstructive techniques based on CFD results, the vibroacoustic and hydroacoustic sounds were reduced to 65.9 and 68.6 dB (temporalis–cartilage technique), 63.5 and 63.1 dB (solidified gelatin sponge technique), and 42.4 and 39.2 dB (solidified gelatin sponge–bone wax technique). In conclusion, the current novel biosensing applications and coupled CFD techniques indicate that the sensation of PT correlates with the motion and impact from venous flow, causing vibroacoustic and hydroacoustic sources that transmit via the air-conduction transmission pathway. The transtemporal reconstructive surgical efficacy depends on the established areal density of applied grafts and/or biomaterials, in which the total transmission loss of PT should surpass the amplitude of the measured loudness of PT.

Design and Simulation of a 2-Degree of Freedom Energy Harvester from Blood Flow for Powering the Pacemaker,Abdelmawgoud M.; Parque V.; Nada A.; Fath El-Bab A.M.R.,2025,Journal of Robotics and Control (JRC),10.18196/jrc.v6i1.23953,"The pacemaker is a device that is used to treat different abnormal heart rhythms. It is usually powered using traditional batteries. These batteries run out of power after about 7 years, necessitating the replacement of either the pacemaker or its batteries for the patient’s survival. This means that the patient will need to undergo surgery for the replacement process which can compromise the patient’s life and increase the probability of being infected, not to mention the operation cost. To overcome this problem, energy harvesters can be a safer substitute for these traditional batteries since they can convert different forms of energy into electric energy, which can be stored and used when needed. In this paper, a 2-degree-of-freedom (DOF) piezoelectric energy harvester from blood flow is designed and modeled. The harvester is designed as a cut-out beam that is fixed on the pacemaker lead that passes through the Superior Vena Cava (SVC). To protect the harvester from being highly distorted by the blood flow, a plastic barrier is added in front of the harvester from the vein’s inlet side. The harvester consists of three layers, a PZT-5A layer sandwiched between two plastic layers. The harvester is designed to have its first and second natural frequencies between 1Hz and 1.67Hz, the normal frequency range of the human heartbeat. The harvester harvests up to 3.8V which is considered satisfying since the pacemaker usually stimulates the heart using a voltage that ranges from 1V to 10V . This voltage can be used to power the pacemaker and extend its lifetime. The harvester was simulated using ANSYS Workbench Software 2020 R2.

An interactive augmented reality software for facial reconstructive surgeries,Guo W.; Forte V.; Davies J.C.; Kahrs L.A.,2024,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107970,"Background and Objective: Surgical trainees need a lot of training and practice before being able to operate independently. The current approach of surgical education mainly involves didactic teaching and psychomotor training through physical models or real tissue. Due to the unavailability of physical resources and lack of objective ways of evaluation, there is a demand for developing alternative training methods for surgeons. In this paper, we present an application that provides additional training opportunities to surgical trainees in the field of facial reconstructive surgeries. Methods: We built a mobile augmented reality application that helps the user to visualize important concepts and experiment with different surgical plans for facial reconstructive surgeries. The application can overlay relaxed skin tension lines on a live video input or a patient's photo, which serve as bases for aligning a skin flap. A surgical trainee can interactively compare different skin flap design choices with estimated final scars on a photo of a patient. Data collection capability is also added to the application, and we performed a Monte Carlo experiment with simulated users (five classes of 100 users each) as an example of objectively measuring user performance. Results: The application can overlay relaxed skin tension lines on a patient's face in real time on a modern mobile device. Accurate overlays were achieved in over 91% as well as 84% and 88% out of 263 generated face images, depending on the method. Visual comparisons of the three overlay methods are presented on sample faces from different population groups. From the Monte Carlo experiment, we see that user actions in each class follow a normal distribution with a distinct set of parameters. Conclusions: This application can serve as a basis for teaching surgical trainees the fundamentals of different facial reconstructive procedures, especially concepts related to relaxed skin tension lines and skin flaps. It can objectively evaluate the performance of surgical trainees in a course.

A prospective and comparative clinical study was performed to assess early clinical and radiological results. Methods: From January 2019 to July 2019, a PSBM was created for every operated acetabular fracture (simulation group). DICOM data were extracted from the pre-operative high-resolution CT scans to build a 3D model of the fracture using segmentation methods. A PSBM was implemented in a custom software allowing a biomechanical simulation of the surgery in terms of reduction sequences. From July 2019 to December 2019, every patient with an operated for acetabular fracture without PSBM was included in the standard group. Surgery duration, blood loss, radiological results and per-operative complications were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results: Twenty-two patients were included, 10 in the simulation group and 12 in the standard group. The two groups were comparable regarding age, time to surgery, fracture pattern distribution and surgical approaches. The mean operative time was significantly lower in the simulation group: 113 min ± 33 (60–180) versus 184 ± 58 (90–260), p = 0.04.

How to predict structural allograft survival in tibial reconstructions,Evrard R.; Manon J.; Docquier P.-L.; Cornu O.; Schubert T.,2025,Cell and Tissue Banking,10.1007/s10561-025-10172-5,"Tibial reconstruction for major bone loss is a challenging surgical situation. For more than 30 years, massive bone allografts entered our therapeutic arsenal as a major tool to reconstruct large bone defect. Despite allograft is valued for its convenience, it is still burdened by a high complication rate. This retrospective monocentric study focuses on the clinical outcomes of massive tibial allografts and their outcome’s prediction. Between 1987 and 2022, the files of 148 massive tibial allografts were retrospectively reviewed (registration number B403201523492). Survival curves were calculated based on the allograft success or failure. Survival curves without revision surgery were calculated following the same design. Finally, multiple logistic regression models were set up to point out variables that influence the allograft survival. After 30 years, 87.2% of the patient retained limb function. However, 55% of the allograft failed and had to be removed (mean survival time is 20.06 ± 2.07 years (CI 16.0–24.1)). The estimate mean survival time is 10.26 ± 1.60 years (CI 7.1–13.4) with less than 20% survival for the allografts without revision surgery after 30 years.

These again require a painful surgery to remove/replace after they have healed as it does not degrade into the physiological environment (PE). Currently, there has already been enough discovery of biodegradable materials that, despite being mechanically inefficient compared to non-biodegradable materials, can completely be biodegraded in PE during and after healing to avoid such problems. While there has been insufficient research on the design of biodegradable implant plates, the implementation of which may help achieve the goal with an effort of high mechanical strength. A novel design of biodegradable embossed locking compression plate (BELCP) is designed for biodegradable materials to approach superior mechanical performance and complete degradation over time, considering all such parameters and factors.

Multi-modal feature-fusion for CT metal artifact reduction using edge-enhanced generative adversarial networks,Huang Z.; Zhang G.; Lin J.; Pang Y.; Wang H.; Bai T.; Zhong L.,2022,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.106700,"Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is one of the most widely-used and cost-effective technology for organ screening and diseases diagnosis. Because of existence of metallic implants in some patients, the CT images acquired from these patients are often corrupted by undesirable metal artifacts, which causes severe problem of metal artifact. Although there have been proposed many methods to reduce metal artifact, reduction is still challenging and inadequate, and results are suffering from symptom variance, second artifact and poor subjective evaluation. To address these problems, we propose a novel metal artifact reduction method based on generative adversarial networks to simultaneously reduce metal artifacts and enhance texture structure of corrected CT images. Specifically, we firstly incorporate interactive information (text) and imaging CT (image) into a comprehensive feature to yield multi-modal feature-fusion representation, which overcomes the representative ability limitation of single-modal data. The incorporation of interaction information constrains the feature generation to ensure symptom consistency between corrected and target CT. Then, we design an edge-enhance sub-network to avoid second artifact and suppress noise. Besides, we invite three professional physicians to evaluate corrected CT image subjectively.

Radiographic film paper is traditionally employed to bidimensionally trace the structures of the contralateral healthy ear in a quasi-artistic manner. Anatomical points provide linear and angular measurements. However, this technique proves time-consuming, subjectivity-rich, and greatly dependent on surgeon expertise. Hence, it’s susceptible to shape errors and misplacement.

However, human skin growth dynamics have not been evaluated in vivo. Previously, we quantified this process in a porcine model and developed a calibrated computational framework. Here, we create patient-specific finite element (FE) models of skin growth in TE using longitudinal 3D photos collected during TE treatment. These geometries enable Bayesian model calibration, accounting for uncertainties in boundary conditions, mechanical properties, and biological parameters. The framework incorporates prior knowledge from the porcine model as well as literature information on human skin mechanics. The likelihood function assesses alignment between predicted and observed geometries, and predicted and observed skin growth. To efficiently sample the posterior distribution, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with Gaussian process surrogates, reducing computational cost. This pipeline is demonstrated in five TE cases. Post-calibration, FE models closely match 3D photos, with errors below 2 mm on average. Notably, Bayesian calibration collapses the critical stretch parameter posterior distribution.

Damage-induced hydrolyses modelling of biodegradable polymers for tendons and ligaments repair,Vieira A.C.; Guedes R.M.; Tita V.,2015,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.05.025,"The use of biodegradable synthetic grafts to repair injured ligaments may overcome the disadvantages of other solutions. Apart from biological compatibility, these devices shall also be functionally compatible and temporarily displayed, during the healing process, adequate mechanical support. Laxity of these devices is an important concern. This can cause failure since it may result in joint instability. Laxity results from a progressive accumulation of plastic strain during the cyclic loading. The functional compatibility of a biodegradable synthetic graft and, therefore, the global mechanical properties of the scaffold during degradation, can be optimised using computer-aiding and numerical tools. Therefore, in this work, the ability of numerical tools to predict the mechanical behaviour of the device during its degradation is discussed. Computational approaches based on elastoplastic and viscoplastic constitutive models are also presented. These models enable to simulate the plastic strain accumulation. These computational approaches, where the material model parameters depend on the hydrolytic degradation damage, are calibrated using experimental data measured from biodegradable suture fibres at different degradation steps. Due to durability requirements the selected materials are polydioxone (PDO) and polylactic acid and poly-caprolactone blend (PLA-PCL). Computational approaches investigated are able to predict well the experimental results for both materials, in full strain range until rupture and for different degradation steps. These approaches can be further used in more complex fibrous structures, to predict its global mechanical behaviour during degradation process. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",TRUE,"Focuses on modeling polymer degradation for tendon and ligament repair, without covering automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery, which is what the review is about."
Automatic early-onset free flap failure detection for implantable biomedical devices,Rothfuss M.A.; Franconi N.G.; Star A.; Akcakaya M.; Gimbel M.L.; Sejdic E.,2018,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2018.2793763,"Objective: Up to 10% of free flap cases are compromised, and without prompt intervention, amputation and even death can occur. Hourly monitoring improves salvage rates, but the gold standard for monitoring requires experienced personnel to operate and suffers from high false-positive rates as high as 31% that result in costly and unnecessary surgeries. In this paper, we investigate free flap patency monitoring using automatic hardware-only classification systems that eliminate the need for experienced personnel. The expected flow ranges of the antegrade and retrograde veins for breast reconstruction are studied using a syringe pump to create the laminar flow seen in veins. Methods: Feature data extracted from the Doppler blood flow signals are analyzed for sensitivity, specificity, and false-positive rates. Hardware is built to perform the classification automatically in real-time and output a decision at the end of the observation period. Results: Experimental results using the hardware-only classifier for a 50 ms window size show high sensitivity (96.75%), specificity (90.20%), and low false-positive rate (9.803%). The experimental and theoretical classification results show close agreement. Conclusion: This work indicates that automatic hardware-only classifiers can eliminate the need for experienced personnel to monitor free flap patency. Significance: The hardware-only classification is amenable to a monolithic implementation and future studies should study a totally implantable wirelessly-powered blood flow classifier. The high classifier performance in a short window period indicates that duty-cycled powering can be used to extend the safe operational depth of an implant. This is particularly relevant for the difficult buried free flap applications. © 1964-2012 IEEE.",TRUE,"Focuses on spotting medical issues during surgery using devices, rather than predicting or assessing how things will look afterwards."
Critical buckling pressure of human abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in the range of physiological pressures and axial strains,Stoytchev S.; Nikolov S.; Antonova M.; Nenov M.,2019,Series on Biomechanics,,"Arteries are subjected to significant mechanical loads from internal blood flow and surround tissue tethering; thus their mechanical strength and stability are essential to normal arterial function. The mechanical stability of arteries in the last decade was investigated using animal experimental data only. The present work aims to expand studies to human AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysms) and compare results about the critical buckling pressure with those published in the literature. Preparations from human aneurysmal tissue were harvested by routine reconstructive operation and investigated by specially designed device in order to determine the corresponding stress-strain relation and Young's modulus. The AAA was assumed as an elastic cylinder whose diameter and length were estimated from CT images; the arterial pressure was taken from recordings during operation. Our simulations demonstrated that the determining factors of the critical pressure were the axial strain, the wall stiffness and the length of the AAA. The major result of the study was that in the physiological range of pressures and axial elongations the AAA is more likely to buckle than to rupture. The current investigation could be a useful tool to determine the critical axial strain needed in vascular reconstructive surgeries and vascular grafting in order to prevent tortuosity or kinking. © Series on Biomechanics 2019.

Multi-view stereo in the operating room allows prediction of healing complications in a patient-specific model of reconstructive surgery,Lee T.; Turin S.Y.; Gosain A.K.; Tepole A.B.,2018,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2018.04.004,"Excessive mechanical stress leads to wound healing complications following reconstructive surgery. However, this knowledge is not easily applicable in clinical scenarios due to the difficulty in measuring stress contours during complex tissue rearrangement procedures. Computational tools have been proposed as an alternative to address this need, but obtaining patient specific geometries with an affordable and flexible setup has remained a challenge. Here we present a methodology to determine the stress contours from a reconstructive procedure on a patient-specific finite element model based on multi-view stereo (MVS). MVS is a noninvasive technology that allows reconstruction of 3D geometries using a standard digital camera, making it ideal for the operating room. Finite element analysis can then be used on the patient-specific geometry to perform a virtual surgery and predict regions at risk of complications. We applied our approach to the case of a 7-year-old patient who was treated to correct a cranial contour deformity and resect two large areas of scalp scarring. The simulation showed several zones of high stress, particularly near the suture lines at the distal ends of the flaps. The patient did show delayed healing and partial flap tip necrosis at one of such predicted regions at the 30-day follow up visit.

Analysis of an early intervention tibial component for medial osteoarthritis,Chaudhary M.E.; Walker P.S.,2014,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.4027467,"Tibial component loosening is an important failure mode in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) which may be due to the 6-8 mm of bone resection required. To address component loosening and fixation, a new early intervention (EI) design is proposed which reverses the traditional material scheme between femoral and tibial components. The EI design consists of a plastic inlay for the distal femur and a thin metal plate for the proximal tibia. With this reversed materials scheme, the EI design requires minimal tibial bone resection compared with traditional UKA. This study investigated, by means of finite element (FE) simulations, the advantages of a thin metal tibial component compared with traditional UKA tibial components, such as an all-plastic inlay or a metal-backed onlay. We hypothesized that an EI tibial component would produce comparable stress, strain, and strain energy density (SED) characteristics to an intact knee and more favorable values than UKA components, due primarily to the preservation of dense cancellous bone near the surface. Indeed, FE results showed that stresses in the supporting bone for an EI design were close to intact, while stresses, strains, and strain energy densities were reduced compared with an all-plastic UKA component. Analyzed parameters were similar for an EI and a metal-backed onlay, but the EI component had the advantage of minimal resection of the stiffest bone.

A High-Sensitivity Tactile Sensor Array Based on Fiber Bragg Grating Sensing for Tissue Palpation in Minimally Invasive Surgery,Li T.; Shi C.; Ren H.,2018,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,10.1109/TMECH.2018.2856897,"This paper presents a novel and high-sensitivity optical tactile sensor array based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) to explore and localize tissue abnormalities during tissue palpation in a minimally invasive surgery. This sensor consists of five separate tactile cells with the same configuration, associated fixations, and holder parts. Each tactile cell is mainly composed of a spiral elastomer, a suspended optical fiber inscribed with an FBG element, and a contact head connecting the elastomer with a threaded connection. The two ends of the fiber were glued on the two sides of the spiral elastomer to form a tight suspension status. This configuration can effectively avoid the FBG chirping failure and achieve a higher sensitivity compared with the conventional direct FBG-pasting methods. The corresponding theoretical model has been derived, and the finite element method based simulation has been performed to facilitate the structure design and investigate both static and dynamic performances. Both static calibration experiments and dynamic loading experiments have been conducted to characterize the sensor's performance. The prototyped sensor can achieve a high resolution of up to 0.93 mN and is able to operate within a force measurement range of 0-5 N with a maximum relative error of less than 8.22%. The further surface estimation experiments and in-vitro palpation implementation on a silicone phantom embedded with simulated tumors have validated the effectiveness of the proposed design.

"Predicting the effect of aging and defect size on the stress profiles of skin from advancement, rotation and transposition flap surgeries",Lee T.; Gosain A.K.; Bilionis I.; Tepole A.B.,2019,Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids,10.1016/j.jmps.2019.01.012,"Predicting mechanical stress contours on skin resulting from local tissue rearrangement surgeries is needed to design optimal treatment plans and avoid wound healing complications. Finite element (FE) simulations of skin tissues have been shown to be a reliable tool in preoperative planning, yet, a major obstacle in the creation of predictive software comes from the inherent uncertainty in material properties of biological materials, and the high computational cost of creating and calibrating virtual surgery models. In this study we build computationally inexpensive surrogates to easily predict stress profiles for arbitrary material parameters and a range of defect sizes in three reconstructive scenarios: advancement, transposition, and rotation flaps. The surrogates are built by first creating a training data set of FE simulations that cover the input space of experimentally-determined skin properties from the literature. A reduced order representation of the training data set is achieved via principal component analysis, and computationally efficient surrogates are then created through Gaussian Process (GP) regression. We show that the GP surrogates predict stress contours with relative errors that are on average 2% in the l2-norm compared to the high-fidelity FE models. We apply the GP surrogates to predict differences in the probability densities of stress contours between two different age groups undergoing the same procedure. By replacing nonlinear FE models with accurate yet inexpensive models that can be evaluated for any combination of human skin material parameters and a range of defect sizes, we aim to enable calibration and prediction of stress contours in individualized clinical cases in the near future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Looks at skin stress modeling for surgery but doesn't cover automatic prediction or assessment of how things will look, so it doesn't fit this review."

Methods The IDEAL stage 0 study included simulation of focal/hemiablation in whole-mount prostate specimens obtained from 100 men who had undergone radical prostatectomies, but met the criteria for focal/hemiablation. The IDEAL stage 1/2a was a prospective, single-arm, Institutional Review Board-approved study of precision prostatectomy undertaken in eight men, who met the predetermined criteria. Criteria for both stages included (1) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤15 ng/mL, (2) stage ≤cT2, (3) dominant unilateral lesion with Gleason ≤4+3 with any number of cores or % cores involved ipsilaterally on transrectal biopsy, (4) no primary Gleason ≥4 contralaterally on transrectal biopsy, and (5) preoperative erectile function score (International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5) of ≥17 (out of 25) without PDE-5i (applicable only to the stage 1/2a study participants). Feasibility and safety of the precision prostatectomy technique, and short-term urinary, sexual and oncological outcomes were studied. Results Analysis of whole-mount specimens in the 100 men showed an index lesion (>1 cm in diameter) in all. Ninety-eight men had satellite lesions smaller than 0.5 cm³ in volume - 46 on the side of the dominant lesions and 52 in the contralateral lobe. If the men in this modeling cohort had undergone focal ablation with a 5-10 mm untreated margin, all except one would have had at least Gleason 6 residual cancer. If they had undergone hemiablation with no untreated tissue on the ablated side, 56 men would have had residual cancer on the contralateral side, of whom 21 would have had clinically significant cancer (Gleason 7 or higher). If these men had undergone precision prostatectomy, with preservation of 5-10 mm of tissue on the non-dominant side, 10% and 4% would have had Gleason 3+4 and Gleason 4+3 disease left behind, respectively. For the stage 1/2a study, the median (IQR) age, PSA and IIEF-5 scores at the time of surgery were 54 (52-57) years, 4.4 (3.8-6.1) ng/mL and 24 (23-25), respectively. All eight patients were continent and sexually active at 12 months with a median IIEF-5 score of 21 (out of 25). At 24-30 months from surgery, the median PSA was 0.2 (range 0.1-0.7) ng/mL. Six men had undergone follow-up protocol biopsies, two, with undetectable PSA, had refused. Two men had residual Gleason 3+3 cancer, with PSA of 0.7 and 0.4 ng/mL, and remain on active surveillance. No man has undergone secondary whole-gland therapy. Conclusions Examination of whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens in men who fit the conventional criteria of focal/hemiablation showed that approximately 21%-68% of men would have clinically significant CaP in the untreated tissue. In a small development cohort, precision prostatectomy was technically feasible, with excellent postoperative functional recovery. At 30 months of follow-up, no patient had clinically significant residual cancer or required secondary treatment. Pending long-term follow-up, a risk-stratified surgical approach may avoid whole-gland therapy and preserve erectile function in the majority of men with intermediate-risk CaP. © 2019 BMJ.

Now, additive manufacturing techniques provide a solution for the fabrication of porous scaffolds with specific geometrical shapes and complex structures. The goal of this study was to design and optimize a three-dimensional tetrahedral titanium scaffold for the reconstruction of mandibular defects. With a fixed strut diameter of 0.45 mm and a mean cell size of 2.2 mm, a tetrahedral structural porous scaffold was designed for a simulated anatomical defect derived from computed tomography (CT) data of a human mandible. An optimization method based on the concept of uniform stress was performed on the initial scaffold to realize a minimal-weight design. Geometric and mechanical comparisons between the initial and optimized scaffold show that the optimized scaffold exhibits a larger porosity, 81.90%, as well as a more homogeneous stress distribution.

We aimed to prevent iatrogenic nerve injury using an electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique and developed a facial nerve detector (FND) with coplanar bipolar electrodes on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate film using micro electro-mechanical systems technology. The discrimination capability of the FND was preliminarily evaluated by analyzing electrical impedances of solutions of various concentrations of phosphate-buffered saline and by extracting sample resistance using curve fitting with an electrical equivalent circuit. The impedances of bone, facial nerve covered by thin bone, and facial nerve of a cadaver were investigated using the optimal frequency range obtained based on the proposed discrimination index. To generalize the sensor output without regard to the shapes and dimensions of the EIS sensors, electrical conductivities of the samples were estimated by matching the extracted sample resistances with resistances obtained in the finite element method (FEM) simulation. Finally, in order to determine the location of the facial nerve before the facial nerve is exposed, resistance and conductivity changes were investigated using an FEM simulation based on the thickness of the bone covering the facial nerve. Thus, physicians can obtain information regarding the thickness of the bone covering the facial nerve while grinding the bone in otologic surgery.

Several repair techniques are employed clinically, with recent focus towards high-strength sutures, permitting early active mobilisation thus improving resultant joint mobility. However, the arrangement of suture repairs locally alters the loading environment experienced by the tendon. The extent of the augmented stress distribution and its effect on the tissue is unknown. Stress distribution cannot be established using traditional tensile testing, in vivo, or ex vivo study of suture repairs. We have developed a 3D finite element model of a Kessler suture repair employing multiscale modelling to represent tendon microstructure and incorporate its highly orthotropic behaviour into the tissue description. This was informed by ex vivo tensile testing of porcine flexor digitorum profundus tendon. The transverse modulus of the tendon was 0.2551 ± 0.0818 MPa and 0.1035 ± 0.0454 MPa in proximal and distal tendon samples, respectively, and the interfibrillar tissue modulus ranged from 0.1021 to 0.0416 MPa. We observed an elliptically shaped region of high stress around the suture anchor, consistent with a known region of acellularity which develop 72 h post-operatively and remain for at least a year.

Abrasion and plastic deformation of the bone during implantation are rarely reported, although they define the effective interference, by reducing the nominal interference between implant and bone cavity. In this study radial forces were analysed during simulated implantation and explantation of angled porous and polished implant surfaces against trabecular bone specimens, to determine the corresponding friction coefficients. Permanent deformation was also analysed to determine the effective interference after implantation. For the most porous surface tested, the friction coefficient initially increased with increasing normal contact stress during implantation and then decreased at higher contact stresses. For a less porous surface, the friction coefficient increased continually with normal contact stress during implantation but did not reach the peak magnitude measured for the rougher surface. Friction coefficients for the polished surface were independent of normal contact stress and much lower than for the porous surfaces. Friction coefficients were slightly lower for pull-out than for push-in for the porous surfaces but not for the polished surface. The effective interference was as little as 30% of the nominal interference for the porous surfaces.

Thus, the forceps with the elastomer can be considered a compliant component, which provides tiny displacements that allow large strain, and the overall diameter is 10 mm. The sizes of the elastomer and forceps are successively determined by analyzing the relationship of several parameters and strain. Then, the linearity analysis of strain beams determines the positions to apply gauges for sensing. The two-dimensional force decoupling models for a single microgripper are proposed based on piecewise analytical polynomials of the strain difference and employed to develop a new three-dimensional force nonlinear decoupling algorithm based on double microgrippers, which realizes single-axial grasping and three-axial pulling forces.

Study of mandible reconstruction using a fibula flap with application of additive manufacturing technology,Tsai M.-J.; Wu C.-T.,2014,BioMedical Engineering Online,10.1186/1475-925X-13-57,"Background: This study aimed to establish surgical guiding techniques for completing mandible lesion resection and reconstruction of the mandible defect area with fibula sections in one surgery by applying additive manufacturing technology, which can reduce the surgical duration and enhance the surgical accuracy and success rate. Methods: A computer assisted mandible reconstruction planning (CAMRP) program was used to calculate the optimal cutting length and number of fibula pieces and design the fixtures for mandible cutting, registration, and arrangement of the fibula segments. The mandible cutting and registering fixtures were then generated using an additive manufacturing system. The CAMRP calculated the optimal fibula cutting length and number of segments based on the location and length of the defective portion of the mandible. The mandible cutting jig was generated according to the boundary surface of the lesion resection on the mandible STL model. The fibular cutting fixture was based on the length of each segment, and the registered fixture was used to quickly arrange the fibula pieces into the shape of the defect area. In this study, the mandibular lesion was reconstructed using registered fibular sections in one step, and the method is very easy to perform. Results and conclusion: The application of additive manufacturing technology provided customized models and the cutting fixtures and registered fixtures, which can improve the efficiency of clinical application. This study showed that the cutting fixture helped to rapidly complete lesion resection and fibula cutting, and the registered fixture enabled arrangement of the fibula pieces and allowed completion of the mandible reconstruction in a timely manner. Our method can overcome the disadvantages of traditional surgery, which requires a long and different course of treatment and is liable to cause error. With the help of optimal cutting planning by the CAMRP and the 3D printed mandible resection jig and fibula cutting fixture, this all-in-one process of mandible reconstruction furnishes many benefits in this field by enhancing the accuracy of surgery, shortening the operation duration, reducing the surgical risk, and resulting in a better mandible appearance of the patients after surgery. © 2014 Tsai and Wu; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",TRUE,"Focuses on surgical planning and creating cutting tools for jaw reconstruction without covering automatic prediction or assessment of how the results look, which is what the review is about."
The Incompatibility of Living Systems: Characterizing Growth-Induced Incompatibilities in Expanded Skin,Buganza Tepole A.; Gart M.; Purnell C.A.; Gosain A.K.; Kuhl E.,2016,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10439-015-1467-4,"Skin expansion is a common surgical technique to correct large cutaneous defects. Selecting a successful expansion protocol is solely based on the experience and personal preference of the operating surgeon. Skin expansion could be improved by predictive computational simulations. Towards this goal, we model skin expansion using the continuum framework of finite growth. This approach crucially relies on the concept of incompatible configurations. However, aside from the classical opening angle experiment, our current understanding of growth-induced incompatibilities remains rather vague. Here we visualize and characterize incompatibilities in living systems using skin expansion in a porcine model: We implanted and inflated two expanders, crescent, and spherical, and filled them to 225 cc throughout a period of 21 days. To quantify the residual strains developed during this period, we excised the expanded skin patches and subdivided them into smaller pieces. Skin growth averaged 1.17 times the original area for the spherical and 1.10 for the crescent expander, and displayed significant regional variations. When subdivided into smaller pieces, the grown skin patches retracted heterogeneously and confirmed the existence of incompatibilities.

Optimization of the flexural rigidity of a concentric pipe used in transmitting rotation for arc-shaped forceps,Noda S.; Takayama T.; Omata T.,2017,ROBOMECH Journal,10.1186/s40648-017-0077-3,"Arc-shaped forceps are important in pharyngeal cancer surgery, endoscopic sinus surgery, and single port surgery. Rotating the gripper of an arc-shaped forceps with respect to its shaft axis can improve the manipulability of the forceps. Concentric pipe structures consisting of inner and outer pipes are often used for this purpose. The inner pipe transmits rotations from its proximal end to distal end. However, the shape of the bent inner pipe is generally different from that of the outer pipe, and this causes large friction between the outer and inner pipes. To reduce friction, a plastic tube is often used for the inner pipe. However, since its torsional rigidity is low, this results in a large twist angle. This paper proposes a procedure to fit a metal bent inner pipe to an outer pipe by adjusting the flexural rigidity of the inner pipe with slits to reduce the friction. The procedure minimizes the twist angle between the proximal and distal end of the arc-shaped forceps by reducing the torque required to rotate its metal inner pipe. We develop a 5 mm forceps with a 3.5 mm inner pipe. The twist angle is 2.8° when a load torque of 20 Nmm is applied, which is a typical load torque for suturing, whereas the twist angle of a PEEK (polyetheretherketone) inner pipe is 24.3° in simulation. Ex vivo experiments show that the required forceps torque is small in simulated clinical scenarios. © 2017, The Author(s).",TRUE,"Focuses on improving surgical tools instead of predicting or assessing aesthetic results in plastic or cancer-related surgery, so it doesn’t fit the review’s topic."
Characterization and assessment of hyperelastic and elastic properties of decellularized human adipose tissues,Omidi E.; Fuetterer L.; Reza Mousavi S.; Armstrong R.C.; Flynn L.E.; Samani A.,2014,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.09.035,"Decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) has shown potential as a regenerative scaffold for plastic and reconstructive surgery to augment or replace damaged or missing adipose tissue (e.g. following lumpectomy or mastectomy). The mechanical properties of soft tissue substitutes are of paramount importance in restoring the natural shape and appearance of the affected tissues, and mechanical mismatching can lead to unpredictable scar tissue formation and poor implant integration. The goal of this work was to assess the linear elastic and hyperelastic properties of decellularized human adipose tissue and compare them to those of normal breast adipose tissue. To assess the influence of the adipose depot source on the mechanical properties of the resultant decellularized scaffolds, we performed indentation tests on DAT samples sourced from adipose tissue isolated from the breast, subcutaneous abdominal region, omentum, pericardial depot and thymic remnant, and their corresponding force-displacement data were acquired. Elastic and hyperelastic parameters were estimated using inverse finite element algorithms. Subsequently, a simulation was conducted in which the estimated hyperelastic parameters were tested in a real human breast model under gravity loading in order to assess the suitability of the scaffolds for implantation. Results of these tests showed that in the human breast, the DAT would show similar deformability to that of native normal tissue. Using the measured hyperelastic parameters, we were able to assess whether DAT derived from different depots exhibited different intrinsic nonlinearities. Results showed that DAT sourced from varying regions of the body exhibited little intrinsic nonlinearity, with no statistically significant differences between the groups. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical details of tissue instead of automatic prediction or assessment of aesthetic results, which doesn't align with the review's topic."
Design and modelling of a variable stiffness manipulator for surgical robots,Le H.M.; Cao L.; Do T.N.; Phee S.J.,2018,Mechatronics,10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.05.012,"In Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), a surgical robot that can access the human colon or stomach via natural orifices should have sufficient flexibility to pass through tortuous paths and to be operated in a confined space. In addition, the robot should possess an acceptable stiffness level to hold payloads during the surgery. This paper presents a new design concept for variable stiffness manipulators using thermoplastic material Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and a flexible stainless steel sheath as a heating media. The stiffness phases of PET can be actively adjusted through temperature. Experiments at different conditions showed that the proposed design was at least as flexible as a typical commercial endoscope in compliant mode and at least 9 times stiffer than the endoscope in stiff mode. In addition, flexural modulus of the proposed manipulator with respect to temperature, current, and time was modeled and validated through both simulation and experiments. A tendon-driven flexible robotic arm integrated with a variable stiffness spine was also developed, and ex vivo tests on fresh porcine tissue were conducted. The manipulator in compliant mode can be easily controlled through the tendons, and it is able to hold its shape against considerably large loads in stiff mode. The results demonstrate not only the high potential of the design concept for the future medical application but also the first steps toward building a complete surgical robotic system with fully controlled variable stiffness. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Focuses on designing and modeling a surgical robot without covering automated prediction or assessment of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer-related surgeries, which falls outside the review’s scope."
Propagation of material behavior uncertainty in a nonlinear finite element model of reconstructive surgery,Lee T.; Turin S.Y.; Gosain A.K.; Bilionis I.; Buganza Tepole A.,2018,Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology,10.1007/s10237-018-1061-4,"Excessive mechanical stress following surgery can lead to delayed healing, hypertrophic scars, and even skin necrosis. Measuring stress directly in the operating room over large skin areas is not feasible, and nonlinear finite element simulations have become an appealing alternative to predict stress contours on arbitrary geometries. However, this approach has been limited to generic cases, when in reality each patient geometry and procedure are unique, and material properties change from one person to another. In this manuscript, we use multi-view stereo to capture the patient-specific geometry of a 7-year-old female undergoing cranioplasty and complex tissue rearrangement. The geometry is used to setup a nonlinear finite element simulation of the reconstructive procedure. A key contribution of this work is incorporation of material behavior uncertainty. The finite element simulation is computationally expensive, and it is not suitable for uncertainty propagation which would require many such simulations. Instead, we run only a few expensive simulations in order to build a surrogate model by Gaussian process regression of the principal components of the stress fields computed with these few samples.

The proposed approach is applied on a real-world problem in the domain of biomedicine - prediction of inner knee temperatures during therapeutic cooling (cryotherapy) after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery. A validated simulation model of the cryotherapeutic treatment is used to generate a substantial amount of diverse data from different simulation scenarios. We apply machine learning methods on the simulated data to construct a predictive model that provides a prediction for the inner temperature variable based on other system variables whose measurement is more feasible, i.e. skin temperatures. First, we perform feature ranking using the RReliefF method. Next, based on the feature ranking results, we investigate the predictive performance and time/memory efficiency of several predictive modeling methods: linear regression, regression trees, model trees, and ensembles of regression and model trees. Results have shown that using only temperatures from skin sensors as input attributes gives excellent prediction for the temperature in the knee center. Moreover, satisfying predictive accuracy is also achieved using short history of temperatures from just two skin sensors (placed anterior and posterior to the knee) as input variables. The model trees perform the best with prediction error in the same range as the accuracy of the simulated data (0.1. °C). Furthermore, they satisfy the requirements for small memory size and real-time response.

Methods: In addition to a standard static clinical evaluation (anamnesis, radiological examination), the software provides a dynamic assessment of the shoulder joint by computing in real time the joint kinematics from a database of activities of daily living. During motion, the precise bone resection (location and amount) is computed based on detected subacromial impingements, providing surgeons with precise information about the surgical procedure. Moreover, to improve the subjective reading of medical images, the software provides 3D measurement tools based on anatomical models assisting in the analysis of shoulder morphological features. Results: We performed an in vivo assessment of the software in a prospective randomized clinical study conducted with 27 patients beneficiating from the planning solution and a control group of 31 patients without planning. Postoperatively, patient’s pain decreased, and the shoulder range of motion and the functional outcomes improved significantly and the rotator cuff healing rate was good for both groups without intergroup differences. The amount of bone resected at surgery was comparable between the groups. The percentage of remaining impingement after surgery was in average reduced to 51% without groups difference. Conclusions: ArthroPlanner software includes all required materials (images data, 3D models, motion, morphological measurements, etc.) to improve orthopedists’ performance in the surgical planning of acromioplasty.

Shape-Locking Mechanism of Flexible Joint Using Mechanical Latch with Electromagnetic Force,Chung D.G.; Kim J.; Baek D.; Kim J.; Kwon D.-S.,2019,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,10.1109/LRA.2019.2897006,"Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has emerged as a procedure to further improve cosmetic profits and reduce the postoperative pain of multiport laparoscopic surgery. However, SILS is a difficult operation due to the limited workspace or accessibility. To improve surgical convenience, flexible surgical robots should be developed and applied to SILS for a large workspace. Flexible robots would penetrate a single incision point around the navel area and can provide a large workspace within the abdominal cavity. However, it is difficult to support the force required for surgical intervention during this process. In this study, a novel mechanism to lock the shape of a flexible joint to support the external forces during SILS is proposed. The developed shape-locking mechanism involves placing a latch between the joints; the shape locks by engagement of the latches via an electromagnetic force. The mechanism is implemented through mechanical coupling, so it can withstand large loads. Furthermore, the driving force of the mechanism is small because it only needs to engage the latch structure.

Prediction of insertion torque and stiffness of a dental implant in bovine trabecular bone using explicit micro-finite element analysis,Ovesy M.; Indermaur M.; Zysset P.K.,2019,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.06.024,"The assessment of dental implant performance is dominated by the concept of mechanical stability. Primary stability is defined as the capacity of a bone-implant structure to bear loads without occurrence of excessive damage and loosening. In order to achieve the highest primary stability, dental implants are inserted into bone using a press-fit procedure. Pre- and postoperative evaluation of primary stability using implantation torque and resonance frequency analysis are valid approaches but do not allow the systematic comparison of different protocols in similar situations. The aim of this research is to develop and validate an explicit, micro-finite element (μFE) methodology to study the effect of different amounts of initial press-fit on implantation torque and initial stiffness of a dental implant. Ten bovine trabecular bone samples were prepared that cover a wide range of bone volume fraction. A dental implant was inserted using two implantation protocols named soft (small initial drilled hole) and dense (increased initial drilled hole). The implantation torque was measured and the stiffness was calculated using an infinitesimal off-axis loading. Finite element simulations of the implant insertion and subsequent loading were performed on micro-computed tomography (μCT) reconstructions of the samples using an explicit solver. Bone was defined as an elasto-plastic material with von Mises yield criteria and hardening. Element deletion was triggered by a threshold in cumulated plastic strains. A sensitivity analysis was performed on friction, hardening and fracture strain to provide a better insight into the effects of these parameters on the results. The implantation torque required for the soft protocol was higher compared to the dense approach in both experiment and simulation due to the higher amount of bone compaction in the first approach. Interestingly, stiffness did not show a significant dependency on the drilling protocol in both experiment and simulation. In conclusion, the explicit microFE methodology developed in this study was able to capture the outcome of two drilling protocols in terms of torque and stiffness and represents a powerful tool to explore the effect of different parameters on primary stability of dental implants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,Focuses on biomechanical analysis of dental implants rather than on predicting or evaluating aesthetic results in plastic or cancer-related surgeries.

Multifactorial sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the relative influence of these surgical factors on the intraoperative joint laxity, graft-tunnel contact mechanics and graft forces. The sensitivity results indicated that the combined variation in tunnel architecture and graft pre-tension at the time of fixation accounts for most of the estimated variance of the three outcomes. Joint laxity was largely influenced by tunnel placement with a modest contribution of the pre-tensioning force. However, variations in pre-tensioning force yielded a significant effect on both the in tunnel and intra-articular graft forces. Tunnel directions played the dominant role in the expressions of the contact shear between the graft and tunnel aperture in the fully extended and reconstructed joint. Given the proposed significance of the shear mediated graft abrasion at the graft-tunnel aperture, these sensitivity results are consistent with the general observation in the Multicenter ACL Revision Study (MARS), femoral tunnel architecture is most correlated with incidences of graft failures. Tunnel direction and graft pre-tension had similar effect on the estimated variance of the contact pressure in the fully extended joint. Data derived from the 48 ACL reconstructed models indicated that the anatomic surgical design may not be the only design that recovers the healthy joint laxity.

Maryland forceps, which belongs to the category of grasper instruments, are often used in minimally invasive surgeries to hold, pull, push, manipulate, and perform dissection operations. During laparoscopic surgeries, often blood and other body fluids ooze from the site of surgery. Typically, suction–irrigation (SI) devices are used to periodically clear these fluids to get a better view of the site of surgery. To achieve this, the removal and insertion of multiple instruments are required. This process has to be repeated numerous times, which significantly increases the time needed for surgery.

Established finite element models (FEM) describing static contouring were implemented as a preliminary simulation step and were followed by subsequent cyclical loading steps. The equivalent Sines stress distribution predicted in each configuration was compared to that in straight rods (SR) and related to the corresponding experimental number of cycles to failure. In the straight configuration, the maximum equivalent stress (441 MPa) exceeds the limit curve, as confirmed by experimental rod breakage after around 1.9 × 10^5 loading cycles. The stresses further increased in the lordotic configuration, where failure was reached within 2.4 × 10^4 cycles. The maximum equivalent stress was below the limit curve for the kyphotic configuration (640 MPa), for which a run-out of 10^6 cycles was reached.

The compliance of the fiber optic force sensor is measured by recording the response of PDMS elastomer films under different load conditions. We use finite element modeling results as a basis for comparing experimental data. The agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data is reasonable and within an acceptable range. © 2018, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",TRUE,"Focuses on designing a fiber optic force sensor for biomechanical use, which doesn't relate to predicting or assessing aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery."
A new framework for characterization of poroelastic materials using indentation,Esteki M.H.; Alemrajabi A.A.; Hall C.M.; Sheridan G.K.; Azadi M.; Moeendarbary E.,2020,Acta Biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2019.11.010,"To characterize a poroelastic material, typically an indenter is pressed onto the surface of the material with a ramp of a finite approach velocity followed by a hold where the indenter displacement is kept constant. This leads to deformation of the porous matrix, pressurization of the interstitial fluid and relaxation due to redistribution of fluid through the pores. In most studies the poroelastic properties, including elastic modulus, Poisson ratio and poroelastic diffusion coefficient, are extracted by assuming an instantaneous step indentation. However, exerting step like indentation is not experimentally possible and usually a ramp indentation with a finite approach velocity is applied. Moreover, the poroelastic relaxation time highly depends on the approach velocity in addition to the poroelastic diffusion coefficient and the contact area. Here, we extensively studied the effect of indentation velocity using finite element simulations which has enabled the formulation of a new framework based on a master curve that incorporates the finite rise time. To verify our novel framework, the poroelastic properties of two types of hydrogels were extracted experimentally using indentation tests at both macro and micro scales. Our new framework that is based on consideration of finite approach velocity is experimentally easy to implement and provides a more accurate estimation of poroelastic properties.",TRUE,"Focuses on testing materials with indentation, which doesn't relate to predicting or assessing aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery."
Skull reconstruction after resection of bone tumors in a single surgical time by the association of the techniques of rapid prototyping and surgical navigation,Anchieta M.V.M.; Salles F.A.; Cassaro B.D.; Quaresma M.M.; Santos B.F.O.,2016,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-016-1415-2,"Purpose: Presentation of a new cranioplasty technique employing a combination of two technologies: rapid prototyping and surgical navigation. This technique allows the reconstruction of the skull cap after the resection of a bone tumor in a single surgical time. Methods: The neurosurgeon plans the craniotomy previously on the EximiusMed software, compatible with the Eximius Surgical Navigator, both from the company Artis Tecnologia (Brazil). The navigator imports the planning and guides the surgeon during the craniotomy. The simulation of the bone fault allows the virtual reconstruction of the skull cap and the production of a personalized modelling mold using the Magics—Materialise (Belgium)—software. The mold and a replica of the bone fault are made by rapid prototyping by the company Artis Tecnologia (Brazil) and shipped under sterile conditions to the surgical center. The PMMA prosthesis is produced during the surgical act with the help of a hand press. Results: The total time necessary for the planning and production of the modelling mold is four days. The precision of the mold is submillimetric and accurately reproduces the virtual reconstruction of the prosthesis. The production of the prosthesis during surgery takes until twenty minutes depending on the type of PMMA used. The modelling mold avoids contraction and dissipates the heat generated by the material’s exothermic reaction in the polymerization phase. The craniectomy is performed with precision over the drawing made with the help of the Eximius Surgical Navigator, according to the planned measurements. The replica of the bone fault serves to evaluate the adaptation of the prosthesis as a support for the perforations and the placement of screws and fixation plates, as per the surgeon’s discretion. Conclusions: This technique allows the adequate oncologic treatment associated with a satisfactory aesthetic result, with precision, in a single surgical time, reducing time and costs. © 2016, CARS.",TRUE,"Focuses on surgical techniques without covering automatic prediction or assessment of aesthetic results, which is outside the review’s scope."
A novel RBF-based predictive tool for facial distraction surgery in growing children with syndromic craniosynostosis,Angullia F.; Fright W.R.; Richards R.; Schievano S.; Linney A.D.; Dunaway D.J.,2020,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-019-02063-4,"Purpose: Predicting changes in face shape from corrective surgery is challenging in growing children with syndromic craniosynostosis. A prediction tool mimicking composite bone and skin movement during facial distraction would be useful for surgical audit and planning. To model surgery, we used a radial basis function (RBF) that is smooth and continuous throughout space whilst corresponding to measured distraction at landmarks. Our aim is to showcase the pipeline for a novel landmark-based, RBF-driven simulation for facial distraction surgery in children. Methods: An individual’s dataset comprised of manually placed skin and bone landmarks on operated and unoperated regions. Surgical warps were produced for ‘older’ monobloc, ‘older’ bipartition and ‘younger’ bipartition groups by applying a weighted least-squares RBF fitted to the average landmarks and change vectors. A ‘normalisation’ warp, from fitting an RBF to craniometric landmark differences from the average, was applied to each dataset before the surgical warp. The normalisation was finally reversed to obtain the individual prediction. Predictions were compared to actual post-operative outcomes. Results: The averaged change vectors for all groups showed skin and bone movements characteristic of the operations. Normalisation for shape–size removed individual asymmetry, size and proportion differences but retained typical pre-operative shape features. The surgical warps removed the average syndromic features. Reversing the normalisation reintroduced the individual’s variation into the prediction. The mid-facial regions were well predicted for all groups. Forehead and brow regions were less well predicted. Conclusions: Our novel, landmark-based, weighted RBF can predict the outcome for facial distraction in younger and older children with a variety of head and face shapes. It can replicate the surgical reality of composite bone and skin movement jointly in one model. The potential applications include audit of existing patient outcomes, and predicting outcome for new patients to aid surgical planning. © 2019, The Author(s).",TRUE,"Focuses on a tool for facial surgery in children but doesn’t cover automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer-related surgeries, so it doesn’t fit the review’s focus."
Comparison of different constitutive models to characterize the viscoelastic properties of human abdominal adipose tissue. A pilot study,Calvo-Gallego J.L.; Domínguez J.; Gómez Cía T.; Gómez Ciriza G.; Martínez-Reina J.,2018,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2018.02.013,"Knowing the mechanical properties of human adipose tissue is key to simulate surgeries such as liposuction, mammoplasty and many plastic surgeries in which the subcutaneous fat is present. One of the most important surgeries, for its incidence, is the breast reconstruction surgery that follows a mastectomy. In this case, achieving a deformed shape similar to the healthy breast is crucial. The reconstruction is most commonly made using autologous tissue, taken from the patient's abdomen. The amount of autologous tissue and its mechanical properties have a strong influence on the shape of the reconstructed breast. In this work, the viscoelastic mechanical properties of the human adipose tissue have been studied. Uniaxial compression stress relaxation tests were performed in adipose tissue specimens extracted from the human abdomen. Two different viscoelastic models were used to fit to the experimental tests: a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model and an internal variables viscoelastic (IVV) model; each one with four different hyperelastic strain energy density functions to characterise the elastic response: a 5-terms polynomial function, a first order Ogden function, an isotropic Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel function and a combination of a neoHookean and an exponential function. The IVV model with the Ogden function was the best combination to fit the experimental tests. The viscoelastic properties are not important in the simulation of the static deformed shape of the breast, but they are needed in a relaxation test performed under finite strain rate, particularly, to derive the long-term behaviour (as time tends to infinity), needed to estimate the static deformed shape of the breast. The so obtained stiffness was compared with previous results given in the literature for adipose tissue of different regions, which exhibited a wide dispersion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical modeling instead of predicting or evaluating aesthetic results, which falls outside the review’s scope."

Although it is the gold standard for cutaneous defect correction today, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we present a novel technique to quantify anisotropic prestrain, deformation, and growth in a porcine skin expansion model. Building on our recently proposed method, we combine two novel technologies, multi-view stereo and isogeometric analysis, to characterize skin kinematics: Upon explantation, a unit square retracts ex vivo to a square of average dimensions of 0.83 × 0.83. Upon expansion, the unit square deforms in vivo into a rectangle of average dimensions of 1.40 × 1.34. Deformations are larger parallel than perpendicular to the dorsal midline suggesting that skin responds anisotropically with smaller deformations along the skin tension lines. Upon expansion, the patch grows in vivo by 1.62 × 1.40 with respect to the explanted, unexpanded state. Growth is larger parallel than perpendicular to the midline, suggesting that elevated stretch activates mechanotransduction pathways to stimulate tissue growth.

"An efficient modelling-simulation-analysis workflow to investigate stump-socket interaction using patient-specific, three-dimensional, continuum-mechanical, finite element residual limb models",Ramasamy E.; Avci O.; Dorow B.; Chong S.-Y.; Gizzi L.; Steidle G.; Schick F.; Röhrle O.,2018,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2018.00126,"The lack of an efficient modelling-simulation-analysis workflow for creating and utilising detailed subject-specific computational models is one of the key reasons why simulation-based approaches for analysing socket-stump interaction have not yet been successfully established. Herein, we propose a novel and efficient modelling-simulation-analysis workflow that uses commercial software for generating a detailed subject-specific, three-dimensional finite element model of an entire residual limb from Diffusion Tensor MRI images in < 20 min. Moreover, to complete the modelling-simulation-analysis workflow, the generated subject-specific residual limb model is used within an implicit dynamic FE simulation of bipedal stance to predict the potential sites of deep tissue injury. For this purpose, a nonlinear hyperelastic, transversely isotropic skeletal muscle constitutive law containing a deep tissue injury model was implemented in LS-DYNA. To demonstrate the feasibility of the entire modelling-simulation-analysis workflow and the fact that detailed, anatomically realistic, multi-muscle models are superior to state-of-the-art, fused-muscle models, an implicit dynamic FE analysis of 2-h bipedal stance is carried out. By analysing the potential volume of damaged muscle tissue after donning an optimally-fitted and a misfitted socket, i.e., a socket whose volume was isotropically shrunk by 10%, we were able to highlight the differences between the detailed individual- and fused-muscle models. The results of the bipedal stance simulation showed that peak stresses in the fused-muscle model were four times lower when compared to the multi-muscle model. The peak interface stress in the individual-muscle model, at the end of bipedal stance analysis, was 2.63 times lower than that in the deep tissues of the stump. At the end of the bipedal stance analysis using the misfitted socket, the fused-muscle model predicted that 7.65% of the residual limb volume was injured, while the detailed-model predicted 16.03%. The proposed approach is not only limited to modelling residual limbs but also has applications in predicting the impact of plastic surgery, for detailed forward-dynamics simulations of normal musculoskeletal systems. © 2018 Ramasamy, Avci, Dorow, Chong, Gizzi, Steidle, Schick and Röhrle.",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical modeling for tissue injury prediction, which doesn’t relate to automatically predicting or evaluating aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery."

The biggest advantage of capsule robots is that they can be swallowed, move in narrow channels, drug delivery and surgery. However, to make itself be able to move in tight spaces, capsule robot must keep its volume small enough which means it also becomes the biggest challenge of the development of capsule robots. This paper carried out a series of simulations and experiments in order to evaluate the characteristic influence of different structures on motion performance for a magnetic-actuated screw jet microrobot (SJM).

Computational modeling for surgical reconstruction of aortic valve by using autologous pericardium,Feng Y.; Cao Y.; Wang W.; Zhang H.; Wei L.; Jia B.; Wang S.,2020,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997605,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of surgical reconstruction of aortic valve using autologous pericardium, and the hemodynamic impact of matching the circumferential direction of the trimmed leaflet to inherent fiber orientation of the pericardium during surgery. A patient specific aortic valve model was built based on CTA data. The reconstructive surgery was carried out on the model following normal operating procedures. FSI simulation was performed to analyze the hemodynamic characteristics among the diseased model, normal model and three operative models with different misaligned angles between the circumferential direction of the substitute and inherent fiber orientation. The differences of EOA, velocity distribution, stress and strain on leaflets, and the valve deformation between the five models were compared and analyzed. The results showed that reconstructive surgery helps enlarge EOA, reduce abnormity of leaflet motion and blood ejection compared to diseased model. There was no significant difference between operative models with different misaligned angles in terms of leaflet motion and flow pattern, but as the misaligned angle increased, greater strain and deformation were observed on leaflets during the diastolic period. The present study demonstrated the instant clinical effectiveness of the reconstructive surgery of aortic valve by the improvement of EOA and flow pattern, and suggested that during the operation it may be unnecessary to match the circumferential direction of the substitute to inherent fiber orientation of the pericardium since the hemodynamic characteristics were insensitive to the fiber alignment, but the strain and deformation increment on the substitutes during diastolic period still raised concern about their durability. © 2013 IEEE.",TRUE,Focuses on heart valve modeling instead of automatic prediction or assessment of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery.

In a recently developed FRC implant, bisphenol A dimethacrylate (BisGMA) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) resin was reinforced with unidirectional E-glass fibers. The addition of a braided glass fiber sleeving to the unidirectional fibers increased the torsional strength (99.5 MPa) of the FRC implants at the expense of the flexural strength (602.0 MPa). The flexural modulus was 15.3 GPa. Two types of FRC intramedullary nails were prepared; first type was FRC as such, second type was FRC with a surface layer of bioactive glass (BG) granules. Experimental oblong subtrochanteric defect was created in 14 rabbits. The defect, which reduced the torsional strength of the bones by 66%, was fixed with an FRC intramedullary nail of either type. The contralateral intact femur served as the control. This model simulated surgical stabilization of bone metastasis. After 12 weeks of follow-up, the femurs were harvested and analyzed by torsional testing, micro-CT and hard tissue histology.

Both image-to-patient registration on base of rigid-body registration and TRE prediction methods are available for spatially isotropic and anisotropic data. This study presents a thorough validation of data obtained in an experimental operating room setting with CT images. Methods: Optical tracking was used to register a plastic skull, an anatomic specimen, and a volunteer to their respective CT images. Plastic skull and anatomic specimen had implanted bone fiducials for registration; the volunteer was registered with anatomic landmarks. Fiducial localization error, fiducial registration error, and total target error (TTE) were measured; the TTE was compared to isotropic and anisotropic error prediction models. Numerical simulations of the experiment were done additionally. Results: The user localization error and the TTE were measured and calculated using predictions, both leading to results as expected for anatomic landmarks and screws used as fiducials. TRE/TTE is submillimetric for the plastic skull and the anatomic specimen. In the experimental data a medium correlation was found between TRE and target localization error (TLE).

This work present a novel despeckling method which effectively exploit non-local self-similarity for restoration of corrupted ultrasound images. The proposed approach consist of three stages. First, an improved optimized Bayesian non-local means (OBNLM) filter in which pixel patch is represented by a new vector form is used to get an preliminary estimation of noise-free image. Then, a new index called redundancy index of each pixel patch is calculated for determining which areas in image have low redundancy. Finally, another new vector form is used to represent pixel patch in areas with low redundancy obtained in second stage to recalculate filtered output, and the recalculated output is superimposed on preliminary estimation to generate final result of proposed method. Methods: The performance of proposed approach is evaluated on simulated and real ultrasound images.

The patient presented with symptoms of rigors and dyspnea occurring immediately after infusion of Wallcur Practi-0.9% saline. Initial laboratory evidence was consistent with severe septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction. His initial lactic acid level was 9 mmol/L (reference range = 0.5-2.2), and he had evidence of acute kidney injury and markers of disseminated intravascular coagulation. All 4 blood culture bottles isolated multidrug-resistant Empedobacter brevis. The patient recovered from his illness and was discharged with ciprofloxacin therapy per susceptibilities. Discussion.

CT image-based computer-aided system for orbital prosthesis rehabilitation,Li S.; Xiao C.; Duan L.; Fang C.; Huang Y.; Wang L.,2015,Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing,10.1007/s11517-015-1307-6,"In this paper, a computer-aided system for orbital prosthesis rehabilitation is introduced.

This facilitates surgeons to design appropriate orbital prosthesis and improve rehabilitation esthetics. Based on the system, the preoperative surgery planning for orbital implant can also be made.

A wearable navigation display can improve attentiveness to the surgical field,Stewart J.; Billinghurst M.,2016,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-016-1372-9,"Purpose: Surgical navigation is typically shown on a computer display that is distant from the patient, making it difficult for the surgeon to watch the patient while performing a guided task. We investigate whether a light-weight, untracked, wearable display (such as Google Glass, which has the same size and weight as corrective glasses) can improve attentiveness to the surgical field in a simulated surgical task. Methods: Three displays were tested: a computer monitor; a peripheral display above the eye; and a through-the-lens display in front of the eye. Twelve subjects performed a task to position and orient a tracked tool on a plastic femur. Both wearable displays were tested on the dominant and non-dominant eyes of each subject. Attentiveness during the task was measured by the time taken to respond to randomly illuminated LEDs on the femur. Results: Attentiveness was improved with the wearable displays at the cost of a decrease in accuracy. The through-the-lens display performed better than the peripheral display. The peripheral display performed better when on the dominant eye, while the through-the-lens display performed better when on the non-dominant eye. Conclusions: Attentiveness to the surgical field can be improved with the use of a light-weight, untracked, wearable display.

A cost-effective surgical navigation solution for periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) surgery,Pflugi S.; Liu L.; Ecker T.M.; Schumann S.; Larissa Cullmann J.; Siebenrock K.; Zheng G.,2016,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-015-1267-1,"Purpose: To evaluate a low-cost, inertial sensor-based surgical navigation solution for periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) surgery without the line-of-sight impediment. Methods: Two commercial inertial measurement units (IMU, Xsens Technologies, The Netherlands), are attached to a patient’s pelvis and to the acetabular fragment, respectively. Registration of the patient with a pre-operatively acquired computer model is done by recording the orientation of the patient’s anterior pelvic plane (APP) using one IMU. A custom-designed device is used to record the orientation of the APP in the reference coordinate system of the IMU. After registration, the two sensors are mounted to the patient’s pelvis and acetabular fragment, respectively. Once the initial position is recorded, the orientation is measured and displayed on a computer screen. A patient-specific computer model generated from a pre-operatively acquired computed tomography scan is used to visualize the updated orientation of the acetabular fragment. Results: Experiments with plastic bones (eight hip joints) performed in an operating room comparing a previously developed optical navigation system with our inertial-based navigation system showed no statistically significant difference on the measurement of acetabular component reorientation. In all eight hip joints the mean absolute difference was below four degrees. Conclusion: Using two commercially available inertial measurement units we show that it is possible to accurately measure the orientation (inclination and anteversion) of the acetabular fragment during PAO surgery and therefore to successfully eliminate the line-of-sight impediment that optical navigation systems have. © 2015, CARS.",TRUE,"Focuses on a surgical navigation system for bone surgery without covering automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer-related surgeries, so it doesn't fit the review’s topic."

Mechanical analysis of eyelid morphology,Zhu L.; Chen X.,2013,Acta Biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2013.04.011,"From a mechanical instability perspective a double eyelid is a double-folded thin film structure on a curved substrate, caused by compression as the film slides on the substrate. The underlying mechanics issues, in particular the requirements for forming a double folded structure, are studied using a modeling/ simulation framework. A minimalist model is employed to explore the wrinkle to fold transition. Refined and enriched models are further developed based on anatomical structures, which demonstrate three critical factors for the formation of double layer folding of the eyelid. First, a crease line in the eyelid is essential where the local bending rigidity is relatively weak. Second, the skin above the crease line should be thin and wide enough. Third, the skin below the crease line should have a relatively large effective stiffness so it can be lifted as a whole when the eyes open. When the eye is opened beyond about 40% of its initial wrinkle wavelength, the double-folded structure emerges. Various types of eyelid morphologies are discussed based on the mechanistic model.

Forty maxillary central incisors were endodontically treated to a size 45 file and then obturated using gutta-percha points and sealer with the lateral condensation technique. The teeth were divided into four groups of ten teeth each. All the posts were of similar dimensions. The first group was restored using carbon fiber reinforced posts (CB), the second and third groups were restored using glass fiber reinforced posts (DP and FW, respectively), and the fourth group (control group) was restored using conventional titanium posts (PP). Half of the specimens of every group were submitted to hydrothermal cycling (2000 cycles, at 5 °C and 55 °C, respectively). All specimens were loaded until failure at a 45° angle with respect to the longitudinal axis at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm min-1.

In our previous study (Liao et al. in Med Biol Eng Comput 49:203-211, 2011), we proposed an algorithm consisting of the 2D snake and image registration using the patient's own diagnostic low-resolution and defective high-resolution computed tomography (CT) images to repair the impaired skull. In this study, we developed a 3D multigrid snake and employed multiresolution image registration to improve the computational efficiency. After extracting the defect portion images, we designed an image-trimming process to remove the bumped inner margin that can facilitate the placement of skull implants without manual trimming during surgery. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a set of skull phantoms were manufactured to simulate six different conditions of cranial defects, namely, unilateral, bilateral, and cross-midline defects with 20 or 40 % skull defects. The overall image processing time in reconstructing the defect portion images can be reduced from 3 h to 20 min, as compared with our previous method.

In order to reduce surgeons' burden, we have developed a master-slave robot system which can provide robot-assisted SILS as if it were performing conventional laparoscopic surgery and confirmed the feasibility of our proposed system. Methods The proposed system is composed of an input device (master side), a surgical robot system (slave side), and a control PC. To perform SILS in the same style as regular laparoscopic surgery, input instruments are inserted into multiple incisions, and the tip position and pose of the left-sided (right-sided) robotic instrument on the slave side follow those of the right-sided (left-sided) input instruments on the master side by means of a control command from the PC. To validate the proposed system, we defined four operating conditions and conducted simulation experiments and physical experiments with surgeons under these conditions, then compared the results. Results In the simulation experiments, we found learning effects between trials (P = 0.00013 < 0.05). Our proposed system had no significant difference from a condition simulating classical laparoscopic surgery (P = 0.23 > 0.1), and the task time of our system was significantly shorter than the simulated SILS (P = 0.011 < 0.05).

However, surgeons often encounter difficulties when grafting prefabricated cranial plates into defective areas, since a perfect match to the cranial incision is difficult to achieve. Previous studies using mirroring technique, surface interpolation, or deformed template had limitations in skull reconstruction to match the patient's original appearance. For this study, we utilized low-resolution and high-resolution computed tomography images from the patient to repair skull defects, whilst preserving the original shape. Since the accuracy of skull reconstruction was associated with the partial volume effects in the low-resolution images and the percentage of the skull defect in the high-resolution images, the low-resolution images with intact skull were resampled and thresholded followed by active contour model to suppress partial volume artifacts. The resulting low-resolution images were registered with the high-resolution ones, which exhibited different percentages of cranial defect, to extract the incised cranial part. Finally, mesh smoothing refined the three-dimensional model of the cranial defect. Simulation results indicate that the reconstruction was 93.94% accurate for a 20% skull material removal, and 97.76% accurate for 40% skull material removal.

The sensor comprises two PFBGs embedded in soft polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) matrix, and one of them is horizontally placed while the other is tilted. The transduction principle is that applied normal and/or shear stresses lead to deformation of the matrix and induce strains on gratings. Finite element simulation reveals non-uniform strain distribution along two fibers for direct imbedding that is verified by theoretical analysis, and therefore four gaskets are used to stretch polymer optical fibers from two ends and to produce strains on gratings. The fabricated sensor is tested by concurrently applying normal and shear forces, and Bragg wavelength shifts of two gratings were found to be linearly dependent on stresses in two directions.

The current development of constitutive adipose tissue models, for the implementation in multilayer computational frameworks for the simulation of human soft tissue deformations, has proved difficult because knowledge of the required mechanical parameters of fat tissue is limited. Therefore, for the first time, human abdominal adipose tissues were mechanically investigated by biaxial tensile and triaxial shear tests. The results of this study suggest that human abdominal adipose tissues under quasi-static and dynamic multiaxial loadings can be characterized as a nonlinear, anisotropic and viscoelastic soft biological material. The nonlinear and anisotropic features are consequences of the material's collagenous microstructure. The aligned collagenous septa observed in histological investigations causes the anisotropy of the tissue.

Simultaneous repair of two large cranial defects using rapid prototyping and custom computer-designed titanium plates: A case report,Morrison D.A.; Guy D.T.; Day R.E.; Lee G.Y.F.,2011,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine",10.1177/0954411911422766,"Custom titanium cranioplasty plates, manufactured by a variety of techniques, have been used to repair a range of cranial defects. The authors present a case where two relatively large, adjacent cranial defects were repaired by custom computer-designed titanium plates. The two plates were designed and fabricated simultaneously using a unique methodology. A 28-year-old woman underwent a corpus callosotomy for medically intractable epilepsy. The surgery was complicated by unexpected haemorrhage which necessitated a second craniotomy. Subsequent deep infection required the removal of bilateral bone flaps, presenting a challenge in the reconstruction of extensive, bilateral but asymmetrical cranial defects. The patient underwent a head computed tomography scan, from which a rapid-prototype model of the skull was produced. The surfaces for the missing cranial segments were generated virtually using a combination of software products and two titanium plates that followed these virtual contours were manufactured to cover the defects. The cranioplasty procedure to implant both titanium cranial plates was performed efficiently with no intra-operative complications. Intra-operatively, an excellent fit was achieved. The careful planning of the plates enhanced the relative ease with which the cranial defects were repaired with an excellent cosmetic outcome. © IMechE 2011.",TRUE,"Discusses just one case involving a custom titanium plate for skull repair and doesn’t cover automatic prediction or assessment of how things look, so it doesn’t match the review’s focus."
Human Blood Pressure Simulation for Stress Analysis in Model of Vasculature Using Photoelastic Effect,Tercero C.; Ikeda S.; Tijerino E.; Matsushima M.; Fukuda T.; Negoro M.; Takahashi I.,2009,International Journal of Automation Technology,10.20965/ijat.2009.p0533,Numerical criteria for evaluating stress on vasculature models have applications in evaluating medical tools and surgical skills enabling better endovascular surgery training and the development of better medical techniques and tools. We propose using the stress produced by blood pressure simulation in the vasculature model wall for this criterion and use photoelastic effect for measuring the principal stress magnitude component. We simulated human blood pressure with 5.6% average error and developed shielded urethane model of vasculature enabling water circulation and avoiding plastic deformation at pressures below 182 mmHg. We developed software to calculate model wall stress. We quantitatively compared in four ranges stress produced on the model wall by blood pressure simulation and a guide wire. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.,TRUE,Focuses on blood pressure and stress in blood vessels without covering automatic prediction or evaluation of cosmetic results in plastic or cancer surgery.
Development and validation of a three-dimensional finite element model of the face,Barbarino G.G.; Jabareen M.; Trzewik J.; Nkengne A.; Stamatas G.; Mazza E.,2009,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.3049857,"A detailed three-dimensional finite element model of the face is presented in this paper. Bones, muscles, skin, fat, and superficial musculoaponeurotic system were reconstructed from magnetic resonance images and modeled according to anatomical, plastic, and reconstructive surgery literature. The finite element mesh, composed of hexahedron elements, was generated through a semi-automatic procedure with an effective compromise between the detailed representation of anatomical parts and the limitation of the computational time. Nonlinear constitutive equations are implemented in the finite element model. The corresponding model parameters were selected according to previous work with mechanical measurements on soft facial tissue, or based on reasonable assumptions. Model assumptions concerning tissue geometry, interactions, mechanical properties, and the boundary conditions were validated through comparison with experiments. The calculated response of facial tissues to gravity loads, to the application of a pressure inside the oral cavity and to the application of an imposed displacement was shown to be in good agreement with the data from corresponding magnetic resonance images and holographic measurements. As a first application, gravimetric soft tissue descent was calculated from the long time action of gravity on the face in the erect position, with tissue aging leading to a loss of stiffness.

Simulating the wrinkling and aging of skin with a multi-layer finite element model,Flynn C.; McCormack B.A.O.,2010,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.10.007,"One of the outward signs of the aging process of human skin is the increased appearance of wrinkles on its surface. Clinical studies show that the increased frequency of wrinkles with age may be attributed to changes in the composition of the various layers of skin, leading to a change in mechanical properties. A parameter study was performed on a previously proposed multi-layer finite element model of skin. A region of skin was subject to an in-plane compression, resulting in wrinkling. A number of physical properties of the skin model were changed and the effects these changes had on the size of the subsequent wrinkles were measured. Reducing the moisture content of the stratum corneum by 11% produces wrinkles 25-85% larger. Increasing the dermal collagen fibre density by 67%, results in wrinkles, which are 25-50% larger. A reduction and change in the pre-stress distribution in the skin model, which represents the natural tension and relaxed skin tension lines in real skin, also influences the wrinkle height in a similar manner to real aging skin. Typically, there can be up to a 100% increase in the height of wrinkles as skin ages. This model would be of benefit in the development of cosmetic moisturisers and plastic-surgery techniques to reduce the appearance of aging. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Current manual landmark and surface-based techniques are time-consuming and not always accurate. Intraoperative ultrasound imaging of the vertebrae, combined with automated registration, could improve surgery by improving accuracy, reducing operative time, and decreasing invasiveness. Methods: We present a simple ultrasound-CT registration technique that is automated, accurate, and robust. Registration is achieved by aligning the posterior vertebral surface, extracted from both CT and ultrasound images, using a forward and a backward scan line tracing method, respectively. The registration technique is validated using a simple plastic phantom in a water bath and a more realistic porcine cadaver in a simulation of open back surgery. Results: Clinically relevant accuracy was estimated by comparing automated registrations with gold standard imaging fiducial-based reference transformations, which yielded target registration errors of under 1 mm for the plastic phantom and under 1.6 mm for the porcine cadaver. Conclusions: Our registration technique demonstrates good accuracy and robustness under clinically realistic conditions and thus warrants further studies on its surgical application. © 2010 CARS.",TRUE,"Focuses on ultrasound-CT image registration for spine surgery, which doesn’t align with predicting or evaluating aesthetic outcomes in plastic or cancer-related surgeries."
A continuum model for the bio-mechanical interactions between living tissue and bio-resorbable graft after bone reconstructive surgery,Madeo A.; Lekszycki T.; dell'Isola F.,2011,Comptes Rendus - Mecanique,10.1016/j.crme.2011.07.004,"We introduce a two-constituent porous continuum as a model describing the long-term growth/resorption phenomena in bone tissues grafted with bio-resorbable materials as driven by mechanical loads. The proposed model is able to account for the interplay between mechanical and biological phenomena which are known to be important for the bone tissue synthesis and the resorption of both bone tissue and bio-material. In particular, in the presented model the Lagrangian apparent mass densities of the natural bone and of the artificial material evolve in time according to precise ordinary differential equations. These latter are obtained by postulating a growth/resorption law and suitable constitutive equations conceived to account for the influence on bone resorption and synthesis of the action of different applied external loads as mediated by biological stimulus. The considered constitutive equations are chosen on the basis of the known biological phenomena occurring in bone resorption and synthesis. We present some numerical simulations for rod-bones subjected to axial external load.

Extraction and reconstruction of retinal vasculature,Fadzil M.H.A.; Izhar L.I.; Venkatachalam P.A.; Karunakar T.V.N.,2007,Journal of Medical Engineering and Technology,10.1080/03091900601111201,"Information about retinal vasculature morphology is used in grading the severity and progression of diabetic retinopathy. An image analysis system can help ophthalmologists make accurate and efficient diagnoses. This paper presents the development of an image processing algorithm for detecting and reconstructing retinal vasculature. The detection of the vascular structure is achieved by image enhancement using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization followed by the extraction of the vessels using bottom-hat morphological transformation. For reconstruction of the complete retinal vasculature, a region growing technique based on first-order Gaussian derivative is developed. The technique incorporates both gradient magnitude change and average intensity as the homogeneity criteria that enable the process to adapt to intensity changes and intensity spread over the vasculature region. The reconstruction technique reduces the required number of seeds to near optimal for the region growing process. It also overcomes poor performance of current seed-based methods, especially with low and inconsistent contrast images as normally seen in vasculature regions of fundus images. Simulations of the algorithm on 20 test images from the DRIVE database show that it outperforms many other published methods and achieved an accuracy range (ability to detect both vessel and non-vessel pixels) of 0.91-0.95, a sensitivity range (ability to detect vessel pixels) of 0.91-0.95 and a specificity range (ability to detect non-vessel pixels) of 0.88-0.94. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.",TRUE,"Focuses on retinal blood vessel analysis for diabetic eye disease, which doesn't connect to predicting or assessing how plastic or cancer surgeries look afterward."
Nonlinear finite element simulation to elucidate the efficacy of slit arteriotomy for end-to-side arterial anastomosis in microsurgery,Gu H.; Chua A.; Tan B.-K.; Chew Hung K.,2006,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.12.015,"The slit arteriotomy for end-to-side arterial microanastomosis is a technique used to revascularize free flaps in reconstructive surgery. Does a slit open to a width sufficient for blood supply? How is the slit opening affected by factors, such as arterial wall thickness and material stiffness? To answer these questions we propose a nonlinear finite element procedure to simulate the operation. Through modeling the arteries using hyperelastic shell elements, our simulation reveals that the slit opens up to a width even larger than the original diameter of the donor artery, allowing sufficient blood supply. It also identifies two factors that explain the opening of the slit: blood pressure which is predominant in most cases, and the forces applied to the slit by the donor artery. During simulation, when we increase the donor artery thickness and stiffness, it is found that the contribution of blood pressure to the slit opening decreases while that of the forces applied by the donor artery increases. This result indicates that sometimes the forces applied by the donor artery can play an even more significant role than the blood pressure factor.

The basic idea is suggesting shape changes aimed to approach similar but more harmonious faces. To this goal, our system compares the 3-D scan of the patient with a database of scans of harmonious faces, excluding the feature to be corrected. Then, the corresponding features of the k most similar harmonious faces, as well as their average, are suitably pasted onto the patients face, producing k1 aesthetically effective surgery simulations.

First, thin-plate spline (TPS) is used to improve eyes' ratio. Then, the composite normal map is created by integrating the reference normal map's double-eyelid area into the patient's transformed normal map seamlessly, which is key to simulation of the double eyelid crease.

Fracture simulation of restored teeth using a continuum damage mechanics failure model,Li H.; Li J.; Zou Z.; Fok A.S.-L.,2011,Dental Materials,10.1016/j.dental.2011.03.006,"Objective: The aim of this paper is to validate the use of a finite-element (FE) based continuum damage mechanics (CDM) failure model to simulate the debonding and fracture of restored teeth. Materials and methods: Fracture testing of plastic model teeth, with or without a standard Class-II MOD (mesial-occusal-distal) restoration, was carried out to investigate their fracture behavior. In parallel, 2D FE models of the teeth are constructed and analyzed using the commercial FE software ABAQUS. A CDM failure model, implemented into ABAQUS via the user element subroutine (UEL), is used to simulate the debonding and/or final fracture of the model teeth under a compressive load. The material parameters needed for the CDM model to simulate fracture are obtained through separate mechanical tests. The predicted results are then compared with the experimental data of the fracture tests to validate the failure model. Results: The failure processes of the intact and restored model teeth are successfully reproduced by the simulation. However, the fracture parameters obtained from testing small specimens need to be adjusted to account for the size effect.

CMM-based procedure for polyethylene non-congruous unicompartmental knee prosthesis wear assessment,Spinelli M.; Carmignato S.; Affatato S.; Viceconti M.,2009,Wear,10.1016/j.wear.2008.12.049,"One of the most recent advances in knee replacement surgery is the Unicompartmental Knee Prosthesis that involves the substitution of only one compartment. Uncertainties on the survivorship of such design led to the improvement of pre-clinical mechanical simulation. To effectively support this market phase with clinically relevant wear data it is important to be able to accurately quantify it and the consequent knee prostheses functionality. The aim of the present study was to validate a coordinate-measuring machine (CMM)-based procedure to assess the wear of a commercially available, non-congruous UKP design after mechanical simulation; gravimetric quantification of material defeat produced, in fact, a reference wear value. The two methods are in good agreement (R2 = 0.73) even if CMM technique systematically overestimates the measured values.

The focus of this research is on mitral valve repair by robot-assisted surgery (RAS) method with tactile feedback. Heart tissue is considered to be touched by a tactile sensor with considering the friction effect. A regularized Coulomb law analogous to elastoplastic theory is used to represent the friction. Since the heart tissue is subjected to repeated loading condition, a generalized standard solid chain is chosen for modeling the heart tissue. To implement the generalized standard solid chain in finite element analysis (FEA), a new splitting strategy is presented. The splitting strategy avoids the complicated conversion procedure from creep function to relaxation function by dividing the total problem into several subproblems. The penalty method is used in the derivation of continuum model for the interaction between the tactile sensor and the tissue.

Two different classes of surface matching algorithms, namely the data aligned rigidity constrained exhaustive search (DARCES) algorithm and the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm are first used in isolation. Since the human bone can be reasonably approximated as a rigid body, 3D rigid surface registration techniques such as the DARCES and ICP algorithms are deemed to be well suited for the purpose of aligning the fractured bone fragments. A synergistic combination of these two algorithms, termed as the hybrid DARCES-ICP algorithm, is proposed.

Application of such a methodology to quantitatively compare postoperative hemodynamics in congenital heart diseases is very promising. In the treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which is a congenital heart disease where the left ventricle is missing or very small, the necessity to feed the pulmonary and systemic circulations is obtained with an interposition shunt. Two main options are available and differ from the sites of anastomoses: (i) the systemic-to-pulmonary conduit (Blalock-Taussig shunt known as the Norwood Operation (NO)) connecting the innominate artery (NO-BT) or the aorta (NO-CS) to the right pulmonary artery and (ii) the right ventricle to pulmonary artery shunt (known as Sano operation (SO)). The proposition that the SO is superior to the NO remains controversial. 3-D computer models of the NO (NO-BT and NO-CS) and SO were developed and investigated using the finite volume method. Conduits of 3, 3.5 and 4 mm were used in the NO models, whereas conduits of 4, 5 and 6 mm were used in the SO model. The hydraulic nets (lumped resistances, compliances, inertances and elastances) which represent the systemic, coronary and pulmonary circulations and the heart were identical in the two models. A multiscale approach was adopted to couple the 3-D models with the circulation net. Computer simulation results were compared with post-operative catheterization data. Results showed that (i) there is a good correlation between predicted and observed data: higher aortic diastolic pressure, decreased pulmonary arterial pressure, lower pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio and higher coronary perfusion pressure in SO; (ii) there is a minimal regurgitant flow in the SO conduit.

Magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) is characterized by fast setting, high initial strength and relatively rapid degradation in vivo. In this study, MPC was combined with CPC to develop novel calcium-magnesium phosphate cement (CMPC). The setting time, compressive strength, phase composition of hardened cement, degradation in vitro, cells responses in vitro by MG-63 cell culture and tissue responses in vivo by implantation of CMPC in bone defect of rabbits were investigated. The results show that CMPC has a shorter setting time and markedly better mechanical properties than either CPC or MPC. Moreover, CMPC showed significantly improved degradability compared to CPC in simulated body fluid. Cell culture results indicate that CMPC is biocompatible and could support cell attachment and proliferation. To investigate the in vivo biocompatibility and osteogenesis, the CMPC samples were implanted into bone defects in rabbits.

Results: The results were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and post-test contrast orthogonal method (multiple comparisons), showing that the laser decreased the area of necrosis in flaps subjected to nicotine, and consequently, increased the number of blood vessels (p < 0.05).

Finite element analysis of a total ankle replacement during the stance phase of gait,Reggiani B.; Leardini A.; Corazza F.; Taylor M.,2006,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.04.010,"Finite ankle replacement (TAR) designs have still several important issues to be addressed before the treatment becomes fully acceptable clinically. Very little is known about the performance, in terms of the contact pressures and kinematics of TAR when subjected to daily activities such as level gait. For this purpose, an explicit finite element model of a novel 3-component TAR was developed, which incorporated a previously validated mechanical model of the ankle ligament apparatus. The intermediate mobile polyethylene meniscal bearing was modelled as an elastic-plastic continuum while the articulating surfaces of the tibial and talar metal components as rigid bodies. Overall kinematics, contact pressures and ligament forces were analysed during passive, i.e. virtually unloaded, and active, i.e. stance phase of gait, conditions. Simulation of passive motion predicted similar kinematics as reported previously in an analytical four-bar linkage model. The meniscal bearing was observed to move 5.6 mm posteriorly during the simulated stance and the corresponding antero-posterior displacement of the talar component was 8.3 mm. The predicted pattern and the amount (10.6°) of internal-external rotation of the ankle complex were found to be in good agreement with corresponding in vivo measurements on normal ankles. A peak contact pressure of 16.8 MPa was observed, with majority of contact pressures below 10 MPa. For most ligaments, reaction forces remain within corresponding physiological ranges. A first realistic representation of the biomechanical behaviour of the human ankle when replaced by prosthetic joints is provided. The applied methodology can potentially be applied to other TAR designs. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-modal registration of speckle-tracked freehand 3D ultrasound to CT in the lumbar spine,Lang A.; Mousavi P.; Gill S.; Fichtinger G.; Abolmaesumi P.,2012,Medical Image Analysis,10.1016/j.media.2011.07.006,"A method for registration of speckle-tracked freehand 3D ultrasound (US) to preoperative CT volumes of the spine is proposed.

Application of BTDO has several clinical advantages over traditional surgical techniques. Over the past few years, several BTDO devices have been introduced to reconstruct mandibular bone defects. Based on the location and outline of the defect, each device requires a uniquely shaped reconstruction plate. To date, no biomechanical evaluations of mandibular BTDO devices have been reported in the literature. The present study evaluated the mechanical behavior of three different shaped prototypes of a novel mandibular bone transport reconstruction plate and its transport unit for the reconstruction of segmental bone defects of the mandible by using numerical models complemented with mechanical laboratory tests to characterize strength, fatigue, and stability. The strength test evaluated device failures under extreme loads and was complemented with optimization procedures to improve the biomechanical behavior of the devices. The responses of the prototypes were characterized to improve their design and identify weak and strong regions in order to avoid posterior device failure in clinical applications.

A three-dimensional analysis of soft and hard tissue changes after a mandibular setback surgery,Kim N.-K.; Lee C.; Kang S.-H.; Park J.-W.; Kim M.-J.; Chang Y.-I.,2006,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2006.06.009,"This paper is concerned with a three-dimensional (3D) analysis on soft and hard tissue changes after mandibular setback surgery. For comparing with previous two-dimensional (2D) cephalometric data, we proposed a three-dimensional registration and analysis method based on the cephalometric knowledge. The 3D changes of bone, soft tissue and the ratio of soft tissue to bony movement were investigated in eight skeletal class III mandibular prognathism patients. CT scans of each patient were taken at pre- and post-operative states. Each scan was registered to a universal 3D coordinate system defined by cephalometric landmarks. A grid, parallel to the coronal plane, was also designed for the comparison of the changes. The bone and soft tissue was intersected by the projected line from each point on the grid. The coordinate values of intersected point were measured and compared between the pre- and post-operative models. In addition, the reproducibility of the universal coordinate system and the grid was evaluated. The facial surface changes after setback surgery occurred not only in the mandible but also in the mouth corner region. The soft tissue changes of the mandible were measured relatively by the proportional ratios to the bone changes. The ratios at the mid-sagittal plane were 77-102% (p < 0.05). The ratios at all other sagittal planes had similar patterns to the mid-sagittal plane with decreased values. All the results conformed to the previous 2D based clinical knowledge and instinct of orthodontists.

Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis methods for determining ten causes of lengthening of a soft-tissue anterior cruciate ligament graft construct,Smith C.; Hull M.L.; Howell S.M.,2008,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.2904897,"There are many causes of lengthening of an anterior cruciate ligament soft-tissue graft construct (i.e., graft + fixation devices + bone), which can lead to an increase in anterior laxity. These causes can be due to plastic deformation and/or an increase in elastic deformation. The purposes of this in vitro study were (1) to develop the methods to quantify eight causes (four elastic and four plastic) associated with the tibial and femoral fixations using Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) and to demonstrate the usefulness of these methods, (2) to assess how well an empirical relationship between an increase in length of the graft construct and an increase in anterior laxity predicts two causes (one elastic and one plastic) associated with the graft midsubstance, and (3) to determine the increase in anterior tare laxity (i.e., laxity under the application of a 30 N anterior tare force) before the graft force reaches zero. Markers were injected into the tibia, femur, and graft in six cadaveric legs whose knees were reconstructed with single-loop tibialis grafts. To satisfy the first objective, legs were subjected to 1500 cycles at 1/4 Hz of 150 N anterior force transmitted at the knee. Based on marker 3D coordinates, equations were developed for determining eight causes associated with the fixations. After 1500 load cycles, plastic deformation between the graft and WasherLoc tibial fixation was the greatest cause with an average of 0.8±0.5 mm followed by plastic deformation between the graft and cross-pin-type femoral fixation with an average of 0.5±0.1 mm. The elastic deformations between the graft and tibial fixation and between the graft and femoral fixation decreased averages of 0.3±0.3 mm and 0.2±0.1 mm, respectively. The remaining four causes associated with the fixations were close to 0. To satisfy the remaining two objectives, after cyclic loading, the graft was lengthened incrementally while the 30 N anterior tare laxity, 150 N anterior laxity, and graft tension were measured. The one plastic cause and one elastic cause associated with the graft midsubstance were predicted by the empirical relationships with random errors (i.e., precision) of 0.9 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. The minimum increase in 30 N anterior tare laxity before the graft force reached zero was 5 mm. Hence, each of the eight causes of an increase in the 150 N anterior laxity associated with the fixations can be determined with RSA as long as the overall increase in the 30 N anterior tare laxity does not exceed 5 mm. However predicting the two causes associated with the graft using empirical relationships is prone to large errors.

The stereo display provides accurate visual spatial perception, and the haptics system provides intuitive haptic feedback when bone fragments are in contact as well as six degrees-of-freedom attraction forces for precise bone fragment alignment. Results: A senior surgeon without prior experience of the system received 45 min of system training.

Optimization of rib surgery parameters for the correction of scoliotic deformities using approximation models,Carrier J.; Aubin C.-É.; Trochu F.; Labelle H.,2005,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.1933879,"Background. As opposed to thoracoplasty (a cosmetic surgical intervention used to reduce the rib hump associated with scoliosis), experimental scoliosis has been produced or reversed on animals by rib shortening or lengthening. In a prior work (J. Orthop. Res., 20, pp. 1121-1128), a finite element modeling (FEM) of rib surgeries was developed to study the biomechanics of their correction mechanisms. Our aims in the present study were to investigate the influence of the rib surgery parameters and to identify optimal configurations. Hence, a specific objective of this study was to develop a method to find surgical parameters maximizing the correction by addressing the issue of high computational cost associated with FEM. Method of Approach. Different configurations of rib shortening or lengthening were simulated using a FEM of the complete torso adapted to the geometry of six patients. Each configuration was assessed using objective functions that represent different correction objectives. Their value was evaluated using the rib surgery simulation for sample locations in the design space specified by an experimental design. Dual kriging (interpolation technique) was used to fit the data from the computer experiment. The resulting approximation model was used to locate parameters minimizing the objective function. Results. The overall coverage of the design space and the use of an approximation model ensured that the optimization algorithm had not found a local minimum but a global optimal correction. The interventions generally produced slight immediate modifications with final geometry presenting between 95-120% of the initial deformation in about 50% of the tested cases. But in optimal cases, important loads (500-2000 N mm) were generated on vertebral endplates in the apical region, which could potentially produce the long-term correction of vertebral wedging by modulating growth. Optimal parameters varied among patients and for different correction objectives. Conclusions. Approximation models make it possible to study and find optimal rib surgery parameters while reducing computational cost.

While the exact mechanism by which IH initiates and proliferates has yet to be fully elucidated, it is clear that the abnormal haemodynamics present in the downstream graft/artery junction are intrinsic in its development. Mass transport disturbances owing to abnormal haemodynamics have been associated with atherogenesis and it is for this reason that an investigation into transport of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a known promoter of the intimal hyperplastic response, at the downstream graft/artery junction was carried out. A steady flow analysis in a three-dimensional, idealized, downstream graft/artery junction was carried out using commercial computational fluid dynamics software. It was found that there is a two-and-half fold increase in the transport of PDGF to the artery wall at the bed of the junction when compared with an idealized, healthy artery. The presence of secondary flows in the downstream arterial section also leads to large disturbances in mass transport.

A predictive study of the mechanical behaviour of coronary stents by computer modelling,Migliavacca F.; Petrini L.; Montanari V.; Quagliana I.; Auricchio F.; Dubini G.,2005,Medical Engineering and Physics,10.1016/j.medengphy.2004.08.012,"Intravascular stents are small tube-like structures expanded into stenotic arteries to restore blood flow perfusion to the downstream tissues. The stent expansion is an important factor to define the effectiveness of the surgical procedure: it depends on the stent geometry and includes large displacements and deformations, geometric and material non-linearity. Numerical analyses seem appropriate to study such a complex behaviour after a free stent expansion. In this study the finite element method (FEM) was applied to a new generation coronary stent. Results from computations were compared with those from a laboratory experiment in terms of radial expansion and elastic recoil. By means of a scanning electronic microscopy the area of plastic deformation were also detected and compared with those obtained in the numerical simulation.

This system employs computer graphics and image-processing techniques for the simulation of a rhinoplasty. Although the presented algorithms themselves are not new, the proposed system exploits the new idea to apply 3-D morphing for rhinoplasty, and simulation results are useful for the physicians. According to patients' expectation of what they would like their noses to look like, our system simulates expected results. Our tools provide quantitative measurements of a nose structure.

Analytical guide wire motion algorithm for simulation of endovascular interventions,Konings M.K.; van de Kraats E.B.; Alderliesten T.; Niessen W.J.,2003,Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing,10.1007/BF02349977,"Performing minimally invasive vascular interventions requires proper training, as a guide wire needs to be manipulated, by the tail, under fluoroscopic guidance. To provide a training environment, the motion of the guide wire inside the human vasculature can be simulated by computer. Such a simulation needs to be based on an algorithm that is both realistic and fast. To meet these two demands, an analytical solution to the problem of guide wire motion has been derived, using a new parametrisation of guide wire shape. The algorithm is highly generic, is entirely based on elementary physics and has good convergence properties (accuracy of 22 micron after two iterations). In an experimental validation of the algorithm in a planar model, the RMS of the spatial discrepancy between the real and simulated catheter positions was about 10% of the lumen size.

Computer supported pre-operative simulation of neonatus cranial bone bending in craniosynostosis surgery planning,Clijmans T.; Mommaerts M.; Suetens P.; Vander Sloten J.,2006,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-006-0024-x,"Craniosynostosis refers to a category of skull malformations caused by premature fusion of one or more sutures in the cranial vault. Frequently, during skull reconstruction surgery, pieces of bone, which have been taken out of the skull, need to be deformed within the plastic region before replacement. Since existing surgery planning software does not allow bone bending simulation, the surgeon relies on his experience to determine the correct curvature and to make sure the bone will not fracture. Therefore, there are two important aspects to the bending algorithm presented in this paper: the visualization and the fracture risk assessment. The Matlab® visualization method allows simulating bending of an STL modeled bone segment, obtained from simulation in commercial planning software, in a realistic way. The estimation of the fracture risk is a valuable addition to the simulation environment as the user is informed about the feasibility of his bending actions. The bone bending algorithm has been successfully applied in two clinical cases of skull reconstruction planning for craniosynostosis surgery.

Computer-based planning of optimal donor sites for autologous osseous grafts,Król Z.; Chlebiej M.; Zerfass P.; Zeilhofer H.-F.; Sader R.; Mikołajczak P.; Keeve E.,2002,Proceedings of SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1117/12.466916,"Bone graft surgery is often necessary for reconstruction of craniofacial defects after trauma, tumor, infection or congenital malformation. In this operative technique the removed or missing bone segment is filled with a bone graft. The mainstay of the craniofacial reconstruction rests with the replacement of the defected bone by autogeneous bone grafts. To achieve sufficient incorporation of the autograft into the host bone, precise planning and simulation of the surgical intervention is required. The major problem is to determine as accurately as possible the donor site where the graft should be dissected from and to define the shape of the desired transplant. A computer-aided method for semi-automatic selection of optimal donor sites for autografts in craniofacial reconstructive surgery has been developed. The non-automatic step of graft design and constraint setting is followed by a fully automatic procedure to find the best fitting position. In extension to preceding work, a new optimization approach based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method has been implemented and embedded into our computer-based surgical planning system. This new technique enables, once the pre-processing step has been performed, selection of the optimal donor site in time less than one minute. The method has been applied during surgery planning step in more than 20 cases. The postoperative observations have shown that functional results, such as speech and chewing ability as well as restoration of bony continuity were clearly better compared to conventionally planned operations. Moreover, in most cases the duration of the surgical interventions has been distinctly reduced.",TRUE,"Focuses on computer-based planning for donor site selection in bone graft surgery, but doesn't cover automatic prediction or assessment of aesthetic results, which is what the review is about."

However, intimal hyperplasia (IH) and re-stenosis often occur after surgery leading to serious clinical problems. A multi-physics computational model with tube wall growth and fluid-structure interactions and an iterative mixed method using finite volume, generalized finite difference and finite elements are introduced to simulate focal intimal hyperplasia and blood flow in rat abdominal artery with a vein graft. Physical parameters and physiological geometries from in vivo experimental data are used in model development and verifications. Our results indicate that the mismatches in geometry and mechanical properties between the host artery and the vein graft cause considerable disturbance in flow shear stress, eddy flow, tube wall deformation, and tensile stress/strain distributions. Focal intimal hyperplasia and re-stenosis process are closely related to eddy flow and low and oscillating shear stresses. A constitutive growth function which governs the IH growth is quantified based on experimental data and computational simulations.

Toward that end we have developed a method of vascular morphology reconstruction based on adaptive control grid interpolation (ACGI) to function as a precursor to visualization and computational analysis. ACGI has previously been implemented in addressing various problems including video coding and tracking. This paper focuses on the novel application of the technique to medical image processing. ACGI combines features of optical flow-based and block-based motion estimation algorithms to enhance insufficiently dense MR data sets accurately with a minimal degree of computational complexity. The resulting enhanced data sets describe vascular geometries. These reconstructions can then be used as visualization tools and in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to offer the pressure and velocity information necessary to quantify power loss.

Mechanical fabrication and evaluation of bioresorbable barbed sutures with different barb geometries,Nambi Gowri K.; King M.W.,2024,Biomedical Materials (Bristol),Institute of Physics,"Barbed sutures have been widely used in clinical applications due to their self-anchoring ability and knotless feature. However, the barbs on current barbed sutures are mostly fabricated by post-processing methods, which are time-consuming and costly. In this study, a mechanical fabrication method was developed to produce bioresorbable barbed sutures with different barb geometries. The barbs were fabricated by a single-step mechanical cutting process on polydioxanone (PDO) monofilament sutures. The effects of barb geometry, including barb length, barb angle, and barb spacing, on the mechanical properties and tissue holding capacity of the barbed sutures were systematically evaluated. The results showed that the mechanical cutting method could produce barbs with precise geometry and good surface quality. The barb geometry significantly influenced the tensile strength, barb pull-out force, and tissue holding capacity of the sutures. Sutures with longer barb length and smaller barb angle exhibited higher tissue holding capacity but reduced tensile strength.

Does the use of a uterine manipulator in robotic surgery for early-stage endometrial cancer affect oncological outcomes?,Ito H.; Moritake T.; Isaka K.,2022,International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,"Abstract  The use of a uterine manipulator (UM) in minimally invasive surgery for early-stage endometrial cancer (EC) remains controversial due to concerns about potential tumor dissemination and impact on oncological outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of UM use during robotic surgery on oncological outcomes in patients with early-stage EC. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with stage I–II EC who underwent robotic hysterectomy with or without UM between 2010 and 2018.

Morphological parameters of IAs have been widely used for rupture risk assessment. However, the neck curve, which is the boundary between the aneurysm sac and the parent vessel, is difficult to reconstruct accurately and consistently. This paper proposes a semiautomatic method for neck curve reconstruction to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of morphological parameters for IA rupture risk assessment. Methods The proposed method first extracts the IA sac and parent vessel from 3D rotational angiography images. Then, a semiautomatic neck curve reconstruction algorithm is applied, which involves initial manual selection of points on the neck region followed by an automatic curve fitting process. Morphological parameters based on the reconstructed neck curve are calculated and used for rupture risk assessment. Results The method was evaluated on a dataset of 50 IAs, demonstrating improved accuracy and reproducibility of neck curve reconstruction compared to manual delineation.

This paper presents an augmented marker tracking method to improve the robustness and accuracy of fragment tracking during PAO surgery. Methods The proposed method combines conventional marker tracking with an augmented model-based approach that leverages the known geometry of the acetabular fragment and the pelvis. The method integrates multiple sources of information to enhance tracking performance, especially in challenging conditions such as partial marker occlusion. Results The augmented tracking method was evaluated on synthetic and cadaveric datasets, demonstrating improved robustness and accuracy compared to conventional marker tracking. The method maintained reliable tracking even with significant marker occlusion and provided accurate fragment pose estimation.

Stand-alone lumbar cage subsidence: A biomechanical sensitivity study of cage design and placement.,Calvo-Echenique A.; Cegoñino J.; Chueca R.; Pérez-del Palomar A.,2018,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,"Stand-alone lumbar interbody fusion cages are increasingly used in spinal surgery to restore disc height and achieve fusion. However, cage subsidence into the vertebral endplates remains a significant complication, potentially leading to loss of correction and fusion failure. This study investigates the biomechanical sensitivity of cage design parameters and placement on subsidence risk using finite element analysis. Various cage geometries, materials, and positions within the intervertebral space were modeled to assess stress distribution and endplate deformation under physiological loading conditions. Results indicate that cage footprint size, shape, and placement significantly influence endplate stress and subsidence risk. Larger footprints and central placement reduce peak endplate stresses, while cage material stiffness affects load sharing but has a lesser impact on subsidence. These findings provide insights for optimizing cage design and surgical technique to minimize subsidence and improve clinical outcomes in lumbar interbody fusion.",TRUE,Looks at spinal surgery devices instead of predicting or evaluating looks in plastic or cancer-related surgeries.

Four lateral mass screw fixation techniques in lower cervical spine following laminectomy: A finite element analysis study of stress distribution,Song M.; Zhang Z.; Lu M.; Zong J.; Dong C.; Ma K.; Wang S.,2014,BioMedical Engineering Online,BioMed Central Ltd.,"Background: Lateral mass screw fixation is a widely used technique for posterior cervical spine stabilization. However, the biomechanical effects of different screw insertion techniques on stress distribution in the lower cervical spine following laminectomy remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the stress distribution of four lateral mass screw fixation techniques in the lower cervical spine after laminectomy using finite element analysis.  Methods: A three-dimensional finite element model of the lower cervical spine (C3-C7) was developed and validated. Laminectomy was simulated at C5. Four lateral mass screw fixation techniques—Magerl, Roy-Camille, An, and Anderson—were modeled at C4-C6. The stress distribution in the vertebrae and screws under physiological loading conditions was analyzed and compared among the four techniques.  Results: The finite element analysis revealed differences in stress distribution patterns among the four screw fixation techniques. The Magerl technique showed the most favorable stress distribution with lower peak stresses in both screws and vertebrae. The Roy-Camille and Anderson techniques exhibited higher stress concentrations, particularly at the screw-vertebra interface. The An technique demonstrated intermediate stress levels.  Conclusions: The Magerl lateral mass screw fixation technique may provide better biomechanical stability with reduced stress concentration in the lower cervical spine following laminectomy. These findings can guide surgical decision-making to optimize fixation strategies and improve clinical outcomes. Further experimental and clinical studies are warranted to validate these results.",TRUE,Focuses on biomechanical analysis of spine fixation rather than predicting or evaluating aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery.

Mechanical valve replacement of the systemic atrioventricular valve in children,Reiss N.; Blanz U.; Breymann T.; Kind K.; Bairaktaris A.; Körfer R.,2006,ASAIO Journal,,"Mechanical valve replacement of the systemic atrioventricular valve in children is a challenging procedure due to the complex anatomy and the need for lifelong anticoagulation. This study reviews the outcomes of mechanical valve replacement in the systemic atrioventricular position in a pediatric population. We analyzed data from children who underwent mechanical valve replacement, focusing on survival, valve-related complications, and functional status. Our findings indicate that mechanical valve replacement can be performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality, but careful patient selection and meticulous surgical technique are essential. Long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for complications such as thrombosis, bleeding, and valve dysfunction. This study contributes valuable information to guide clinical decision-making in managing systemic atrioventricular valve disease in children.",TRUE,"Focuses on clinical results of heart valve surgery in children rather than predicting or assessing aesthetic results in plastic or cancer-related surgery, so it doesn't fit the review topic."
Differences in histochemical characteristics of gingival collagen after ER:YAG laser periodontal plastic surgery,Kesler G.; Koren R.; Kesler A.; Kristt D.; Gal R.; Gabi K.,2000,Journal of Clinical Laser Medicine and Surgery,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the histochemical characteristics of gingival collagen after periodontal plastic surgery using an erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser. Gingival samples were obtained from 10 patients who underwent periodontal plastic surgery with the Er:YAG laser and from 10 patients who underwent conventional surgery. The samples were stained with picrosirius red and examined under polarized light microscopy to assess collagen fiber organization and maturation. The results showed that collagen fibers in the laser-treated group were more organized and exhibited greater birefringence, indicating enhanced collagen maturation compared to the conventional surgery group. These findings suggest that the Er:YAG laser may promote better collagen remodeling and healing in gingival tissues following periodontal plastic surgery.",TRUE,"Focuses on histochemical analysis of gum tissue after surgery without covering automatic prediction or aesthetic outcome evaluation, which falls outside the review's topic."
Histological evaluation of medial patellofemoral ligament reconstructed using the Leeds-Keio ligament prosthesis,Nomura E.; Inoue M.; Sugiura H.,2005,Biomaterials,,"The medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is an important soft tissue restraint to lateral patellar displacement. Reconstruction of the MPFL is a useful surgical procedure for recurrent patellar dislocation. The Leeds-Keio (LK) ligament prosthesis is a polyester mesh ligament prosthesis that has been used for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the histological changes of the LK ligament prosthesis used for MPFL reconstruction in a rabbit model. The MPFL was reconstructed using the LK ligament prosthesis in 24 rabbits. The rabbits were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. Histological evaluation was performed to assess the tissue ingrowth and remodeling of the prosthesis. At 2 weeks, fibroblast infiltration and neovascularization were observed in the prosthesis. At 4 weeks, collagen fibers were aligned along the longitudinal axis of the prosthesis. At 8 and 12 weeks, the prosthesis was well incorporated with dense collagen fibers and fibroblasts, resembling native ligament tissue. These findings suggest that the LK ligament prosthesis can be effectively incorporated into host tissue and may be a useful graft for MPFL reconstruction.",TRUE,"Looks at ligament reconstruction in animals, which doesn’t connect to predicting or assessing aesthetic results in plastic or cancer-related surgeries."
Biocompatibility and degradation of poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid)/calcium phosphate cement composites,Ruhé P.Q.; Hedberg E.L.; Padron N.T.; Spauwen P.H.M.; Jansen J.A.; Mikos A.G.,2005,Journal of Biomedical Materials Research - Part A,,"Biodegradable composites of poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and calcium phosphate cement (CPC) were prepared and evaluated for their biocompatibility and degradation behavior. The composites were fabricated by mixing CPC powder with PLGA solution, followed by setting and drying. In vitro degradation studies showed that the composites exhibited a controlled degradation rate, with the PLGA component degrading faster than the CPC matrix. Cytotoxicity tests using L929 fibroblast cells indicated good biocompatibility of the composites, with no significant cytotoxic effects observed. In vivo implantation in rabbit femoral defects demonstrated that the composites supported new bone formation and gradually degraded over time, with minimal inflammatory response. These results suggest that PLGA/CPC composites have potential as biodegradable bone graft materials with favorable biocompatibility and degradation characteristics.",TRUE,"Focuses on bone graft materials' biocompatibility and degradation, without touching on predicting or assessing aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery, so it doesn’t fit the review’s topic."
