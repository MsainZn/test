Chemical-physical behavior of Hydroxyapatite: A modeling approach,Guerfi Z.; Kribaa O.K.; Djouama H.,2024,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2023.106229,"Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is a ceramic composed of calcium phosphate, frequently employed as a bone substitute material due to its biocompatibility and bioactivity. Over the past century, there has been substantial attention in fields such as orthopedics and plastic surgery. Remarkably, synthetic HAp exhibits properties akin to those found in natural bone and teeth. Computational theoretical chemistry focuses on numerically computing molecular electronic structures and interactions. As chemistry education evolves, it's imperative to acknowledge the increasing significance of computational tools in research. Density Functional Theory (DFT) stands out as the most widely adopted method in contemporary computational chemistry. In this study, we synthesized Hydroxyapatite (HAp) via the double decomposition method using synthetic sources. The synthesized materials underwent thorough characterization, including X-ray Diffraction (XRD), UV–visible spectroscopy, and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy under various conditions. Additionally, we performed quantum mechanical computations on the HAp molecule using density functional theory. Our results were then compared with experimental data. Our experimental findings highlight the successful synthesis of HAp, particularly under specific temperature conditions. Moreover, the quantum chemistry calculations exhibited excellent agreement with the experimental results, especially in terms of spectroscopic characterizations. © 2023",FALSE,

Finite Element Analysis and Simulation of 316L Stainless Steel and Titanium Alloy for Orthopedic Hip and Knee Prosthetics,Ikumapayi O.M.; Bankole O.O.; Bayode A.; Onu P.; Ting T.T.,2025,Prosthesis,10.3390/prosthesis7030064,"Background: Ferrous metals are used extensively in the manufacturing of plates, pins, Kirschner wires (K-wires), and screws, and in the performance of partial and total joint replacement surgeries for the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. The primary surgical procedures commonly performed are hip and knee replacement surgeries. Metals possess a combination of high modulus, yield point, and ductility, rendering them well suited for load-bearing applications, as they can withstand significant loads without experiencing substantial deformations or permanent alterations in their dimensions. Application of metals and alloys is of prime importance in orthopedics as they lead the way to overcoming many issues encountered in implant use. In some instances, pure metals are used, but alloys consisting of two or more elements typically exhibit greater material characteristics, including corrosion resistance as well as toughness. The first item to address when selecting a metallic implant material is its biocompatibility. In this regard, three classes of materials are also commonly known as biomedical metals—316L stainless steel, pure titanium, and titanium alloys. Objective: The aim of this work is to create a model describing the material behavior and then simulate the metals under a load of 2300 N, which is equivalent to plastic loading. Methods: Under ten different case studies, a sub-routine was developed to combine the material characteristics of titanium and 316L stainless steel with the software. Results: The outcomes of the research were then investigated. A femur model was created using ANSYS software, and two materials, stainless steel and titanium, were used. The model was then exposed to a force of 2300 N. © 2025 by the authors.",TRUE,"Talks about metal implants, not plastic or cancer surgery aesthetics."
Experimental and numerical analysis of innovative processes for producing a resorbable cheekbone prosthesis,Guglielmi P.; Cusanno A.; Bagudanch I.; Centeno G.; Ferrer I.; Garcia-Romeu M.L.; Palumbo G.,2021,Journal of Manufacturing Processes,10.1016/j.jmapro.2021.07.060,"Magnesium alloys have gained interest in biomedical applications due to the mechanical properties (very similar to the human bones) and the capability to be absorbed (additional surgery steps after the implantation not necessary). But suitable manufacturing techniques are required for these alloys, since the standard ones (machining, casting) or even the newest (additive) cannot be successfully adopted in every situation or cannot guarantee the requirements in terms of precision or cost. In the present paper two sheet forming processes (the Super Plastic Forming and the Incremental Sheet Forming) have been investigated for manufacturing a resorbable cheekbone implant using the Mg alloy AZ31B. An experimental/numerical approach was adopted: specific tests were conducted for determining the material behaviour to be implemented in the process simulations used for designing both the manufacturing processes; finally some prototypes of the investigated case study were produced and the post forming characteristics (thickness, roughness, accuracy) evaluated. Both the processes allowed to successfully and optimally produce the resorbable prosthesis adopted as case study, which revealed to be characterised by good enough surface quality (especially in the case of the Super Plastic Forming) and uniform thickness distribution (especially in the case of the Incremental Sheet Forming). © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",FALSE,
"Vascular anastomoses, hemodynamics and hemorheology: Some general thoughts and open questions",Nemeth N.,2022,Series on Biomechanics,10.7546/SB.09.2022,"Safe and well-functioning vascular anastomoses are essential in the everyday practice of vascular surgery, heart surgery, transplantation surgery as well as in reconstructive procedures, including microsurgical approaches. Regeneration of artificial vascular anastomoses, especially the maturation of fistulas and venous grafts, is strongly influenced by the hemodynamic forces driven by the flow characteristics as well. Exploring the hemorheological and hemodynamic conditions thus is inevitable to understand better the physiology and pathophysiology of the regeneration of vascular anastomoses and graft implantations, as well as in other vascular surgical interventions. In this paper main aspects and findings of experimental surgical and microsurgical models are summarized, studying artificial arterio-venous fistulas, porto-caval shunts, and various grafts using in vivo measurements, hemorheological and hemodynamic investigations, as well as special 3D flow simulation studies on ex vivo vascular segments. © 2022, Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite.

Eco-friendly synthesis of mesoporous bioactive glass ceramics and functionalization for drug delivery and hard tissue engineering applications,Tabassum S.; Saqib M.; Batool M.; Sharif F.; Gilani M.A.; Huck O.,2024,Biomedical Materials (Bristol),10.1088/1748-605X/ad2c19,"Hard tissue regenerative mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) has traditionally been synthesized using costly and toxic alkoxysilane agents and harsh conditions. In this study, MBG was synthesized using the cheaper reagent SiO2 by using a co-precipitation approach. The surface properties of MBG ceramic were tailored by functionalizing with amino and carboxylic groups, aiming to develop an efficient drug delivery system for treating bone infections occurring during or after reconstruction surgeries. The amino groups were introduced through a salinization reaction, while the carboxylate groups were added via a chain elongation reaction. The MBG, MBG-NH2, and MBG-NH-COOH were analyzed by using various techniques: x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The XRD results confirmed the successful preparation of MBG, and the FTIR results indicated successful functionalization. BET analysis revealed that the prepared samples were mesoporous, and functionalization tuned their surface area and surface properties. Cefixime, an antibiotic, was loaded onto MBG, MBG-NH2, and MBG-NH-COOH to test their drug-carrying capacity. Comparatively, MBG-NH-COOH showed good drug loading and sustained release behavior. The release of the drug followed the Fickian diffusion mechanism.

An Advanced Human Bone Tissue Culture Model for the Assessment of Implant Osteointegration In Vitro,Maglio M.; Fini M.; Sartori M.; Codispoti G.; Borsari V.; Dallari D.; Ambretti S.; Rocchi M.; Tschon M.,2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,10.3390/ijms25105322,"In the field of biomaterials for prosthetic reconstructive surgery, there is the lack of advanced innovative methods to investigate the potentialities of smart biomaterials before in vivo tests. Despite the complex osteointegration process being difficult to recreate in vitro, this study proposes an advanced in vitro tissue culture model of osteointegration using human bone. Cubic samples of trabecular bone were harvested, as waste material, from hip arthroplasty; inner cylindrical defects were created and assigned to the following groups: (1) empty defects (CTRneg); (2) defects implanted with a cytotoxic copper pin (CTRpos); (3) defects implanted with standard titanium pins (Ti). Tissues were dynamically cultured in mini rotating bioreactors and assessed weekly for viability and sterility. After 8 weeks, immunoenzymatic, microtomographic, histological, and histomorphometric analyses were performed. The model was able to simulate the effects of implantation of the materials, showing a drop in viability in CTR+, while Ti appears to have a trophic effect on bone. MicroCT and a histological analysis supported the results, with signs of matrix and bone deposition at the Ti implant site. Data suggest the reliability of the tested model in recreating the osteointegration process in vitro with the aim of reducing and refining in vivo preclinical models. © 2024 by the authors.",FALSE,
A Miniaturized Ultrasonic Micro-Hole Perforator for Minimally Invasive Craniotomy,Liao S.; Li X.; Deng M.; Liu B.; Wang Y.; Saw S.N.; Li Z.,2023,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2023.3234965,"Objective: Micro-hole perforation on skull is urgently desired for minimally invasive insertion of micro-tools in brain for diagnostic or treatment purpose. However, a micro drill bit would easily fracture, making it difficult to safely generate a micro-hole on the hard skull. Methods: In this study, we present a method for ultrasonic vibration assisted micro-hole perforation on skull in a manner similar to subcutaneous injection on soft tissue. For this purpose, a high amplitude miniaturized ultrasonic tool with a 500 μm tip diameter micro-hole perforator was developed with simulation and experimental characterization. In-depth investigation of micro-hole generation mechanism was performed with systematic experiments on animal skull with a bespoke test rig; effects of vibration amplitude and feed rate on hole forming characteristics were systematically studied. It was observed that by exploiting skull bone's unique structural and material properties, the ultrasonic micro-perforator could locally damage bone tissue with micro-porosities, induce sufficient plastic deformation to bone tissue around the micro-hole and refrain elastic recovery after tool withdraw, generating a micro-hole on skull without material. Results: Under optimized conditions, high quality micro-holes could be formed on the hard skull with a force (<1 N) even smaller than that for subcutaneous injection on soft skin.

A comprehensive simulation framework for predicting the eCLIPs implant crimping into a catheter and its deployment mechanisms,Jahandardoost M.; Ricci D.; Milani A.S.; Jahandardoost M.; Grecov D.,2024,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2023.106227,"Tubular flow diverters (FDs) represent an important subset of the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms (CAs), acting to reduce aneurysm inflow, eventually resulting in aneurysm thrombosis and occlusion. eCLIPs (product of Evasc Neurovascular Enterprises, Vancouver, Canada), an innovative non-tubular implant causes flow diversion by bridging the neck of bifurcation CAs. However, in a small subset of challenging bifurcation aneurysms with fusiform pathology, the currently available eCLIPs models do not provide sufficient neck bridging resulting in a gap created between the device structure and the aneurysm/artery wall. To overcome this challenge, a new design of the eCLIPs (VR-eCLIPs) was developed by varying the rib length to cover such an inflow gap. To optimize the new product development process, and avoiding expensive and time-consuming iterative manufacture of prototype devices, we have developed a new finite element model to simulate the crimping and expansion processes of the VR-eCLIPs implant, and assess the possibility of plastic deformation. Results indicated that neither eCLIPs nor VR-eCLIPs experience plastic deformation during the crimping process. Upon full expansion, the ribs of VR-eCLIPs interact with the aneurysm and artery wall to cover the inflow gap that exists in certain challenging anatomies. This process serves as a basis to expedite design development prior to prototype manufacturing. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,
3D-Guided Face Manipulation of 2D Images for the Prediction of Post-Operative Outcome after Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery,Andlauer R.; Wachter A.; Schaufelberger M.; Weichel F.; Kuhle R.; Freudlsperger C.; Nahm W.,2021,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2021.3096081,"Cranio-maxillofacial surgery often alters the aesthetics of the face which can be a heavy burden for patients to decide whether or not to undergo surgery. Today, physicians can predict the post-operative face using surgery planning tools to support the patient's decision-making. While these planning tools allow a simulation of the post-operative face, the facial texture must usually be captured by another 3D texture scan and subsequently mapped on the simulated face. This approach often results in face predictions that do not appear realistic or lively looking and are therefore ill-suited to guide the patient's decision-making. Instead, we propose a method using a generative adversarial network to modify a facial image according to a 3D soft-tissue estimation of the post-operative face. To circumvent the lack of available data pairs between pre- and post-operative measurements we propose a semi-supervised training strategy using cycle losses that only requires paired open-source data of images and 3D surfaces of the face's shape. After training on 'in-the-wild' images we show that our model can realistically manipulate local regions of a face in a 2D image based on a modified 3D shape. We then test our model on four clinical examples where we predict the post-operative face according to a 3D soft-tissue prediction of surgery outcome, which was simulated by a surgery planning tool. As a result, we aim to demonstrate the potential of our approach to predict realistic post-operative images of faces without the need of paired clinical data, physical models, or 3D texture scans. © 2021 IEEE.",FALSE,
SERV-CT: A disparity dataset from cone-beam CT for validation of endoscopic 3D reconstruction,Edwards P.J.E.; Psychogyios D.; Speidel S.; Maier-Hein L.; Stoyanov D.,2022,Medical Image Analysis,10.1016/j.media.2021.102302,"In computer vision, reference datasets from simulation and real outdoor scenes have been highly successful in promoting algorithmic development in stereo reconstruction. Endoscopic stereo reconstruction for surgical scenes gives rise to specific problems, including the lack of clear corner features, highly specular surface properties and the presence of blood and smoke. These issues present difficulties for both stereo reconstruction itself and also for standardised dataset production. Previous datasets have been produced using computed tomography (CT) or structured light reconstruction on phantom or ex vivo models. We present a stereo-endoscopic reconstruction validation dataset based on cone-beam CT (SERV-CT). Two ex vivo small porcine full torso cadavers were placed within the view of the endoscope with both the endoscope and target anatomy visible in the CT scan. Subsequent orientation of the endoscope was manually aligned to match the stereoscopic view and benchmark disparities, depths and occlusions are calculated. The requirement of a CT scan limited the number of stereo pairs to 8 from each ex vivo sample. For the second sample an RGB surface was acquired to aid alignment of smooth, featureless surfaces. Repeated manual alignments showed an RMS disparity accuracy of around 2 pixels and a depth accuracy of about 2 mm. A simplified reference dataset is provided consisting of endoscope image pairs with corresponding calibration, disparities, depths and occlusions covering the majority of the endoscopic image and a range of tissue types, including smooth specular surfaces, as well as significant variation of depth. We assessed the performance of various stereo algorithms from online available repositories. There is a significant variation between algorithms, highlighting some of the challenges of surgical endoscopic images. The SERV-CT dataset provides an easy to use stereoscopic validation for surgical applications with smooth reference disparities and depths covering the majority of the endoscopic image. This complements existing resources well and we hope will aid the development of surgical endoscopic anatomical reconstruction algorithms. © 2021 The Authors",FALSE,

A method for assessing guide layout and error on implant accuracy,Xu L.; Tian X.; Wu J.,2024,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108824,"Functional and esthetic results require accurate implant placement. We aimed to develop a predictive method for assessing guide layout and error on implant accuracy. A mathematical model for position error analysis was constructed based on triangular mesh data. This model examines the relationship between the spatial shifts of multiple surfaces and the spatial shifts of specific points. It involves encasing these surfaces in a cuboid bounding box and expressing them in a local coordinate system. The influence of positioning surface error and layout of surgical guide were researched with a simulation test. The result shows that error in the implant site position is directly related to the error in the guide locating surface under the same layout. When the guide locating surface layout varies, as the length, width, and height of the minimum cuboid envelope increase, the maximum deviation in the implant site position decreases. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,
Design and development of model eye for retina laser by using additive manufacturing,Pugalendhi A.; Ranganathan R.; Venkatapathy N.; Narendran K.; Shah P.K.,2021,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine",10.1177/0954411920960548,"Surgical skill of the surgeon can be improved by surgical simulation. Especially in ophthalmology, it is impossible to use real human/non-human primate eyes for ophthalmology surgery practice. However, surgical practice is most important for ophthalmologist. The retina laser surgery is one of the ophthalmology surgeries and it requires more surgical practice for surgeons to use the laser beam precisely to coagulate and fuse small areas of tissue. Dealing with the prospect of vision reduction or vision loss presents a peculiar problem and that can be highly stressful and frustrating for both doctors and patients. In this regard, training for indirect ophthalmoscopy and retinal photocoagulation is undergone using model eyes instead of real eyes. Properties and functioning of an existing model eye are huge and they differ from real human eye such as casings are completely rigid and focusing of retinal fundus is not completely covered. Therefore, this research concentrates to develop a model eye that assimilates close to the human eye by focussing on the maximum viewing area that is not done at the moment. Finally, the design and development of re-engineered model eye for retina laser is fabricated by additive manufacturing. Compared to existing plastic model eye, viewing area and viewing angle of the re-engineered model eye is increased by 16.66% and 6.14%, respectively. Due to design modifications and elimination of the insert, it can be reduced by 18.99% and 13.95% of height and weight of the top casing respectively. Developed re-engineered model eye will improve the surgical and diagnostic skill of the surgeon and increase their confidence and proficiency. It also augments the effective use of essential ophthalmic instruments. Additionally, it can reduce the surgical error and meet the existing demand of actual eyes for surgical practices. © IMechE 2020.",FALSE,
Analysis of In Vivo Skin Anisotropy Using Elastic Wave Measurements and Bayesian Modelling,Nagle M.; Price S.; Trotta A.; Destrade M.; Fop M.; Ní Annaidh A.,2023,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10439-023-03185-2,"In vivo skin exhibits viscoelastic, hyper-elastic and non-linear characteristics. It is under a constant state of non-equibiaxial tension in its natural configuration and is reinforced with oriented collagen fibers, which gives rise to anisotropic behaviour. Understanding the complex mechanical behaviour of skin has relevance across many sectors including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and surgery. However, there is a dearth of quality data characterizing the anisotropy of human skin in vivo. The data available in the literature is usually confined to limited population groups and/or limited angular resolution. Here, we used the speed of elastic waves travelling through the skin to obtain measurements from 78 volunteers ranging in age from 3 to 93 years old. Using a Bayesian framework allowed us to analyse the effect that age, gender and level of skin tension have on the skin anisotropy and stiffness. First, we propose a new measurement of anisotropy based on the eccentricity of angular data and conclude that it is a more robust measurement when compared to the classic “anisotropic ratio”. Our analysis then concluded that in vivo skin anisotropy increases logarithmically with age, while the skin stiffness increases linearly along the direction of Langer Lines. We also concluded that the gender does not significantly affect the level of skin anisotropy, but it does affect the overall stiffness, with males having stiffer skin on average. Finally, we found that the level of skin tension significantly affects both the anisotropy and stiffness measurements employed here. This indicates that elastic wave measurements may have promising applications in the determination of in vivo skin tension. In contrast to earlier studies, these results represent a comprehensive assessment of the variation of skin anisotropy with age and gender using a sizeable dataset and robust modern statistical analysis. This data has implications for the planning of surgical procedures and questions the adoption of universal cosmetic surgery practices for very young or elderly patients. © 2023, The Author(s).",FALSE,

Recent critiques of our lab’s currently deployed silicone surrogate have highlighted numerous areas for improvement. To further refine our models, our group’s objective is to find a composition of materials that is closest in fidelity to native oral mucosa during surgical rehearsal by expert craniofacial surgeons. Fifteen platinum silicone-based surrogate samples were constructed with variable hardness and slacker percentages. These samples underwent evaluation of tactile sensation, hardness, needle puncture, cut resistance, suture retention, defect repair, and tensile elasticity. Expert craniofacial surgeon evaluators provided focused qualitative feedback on selected top-performing samples for further assessment and statistical comparisons. An evaluation revealed surrogate characteristics that were satisfactory and exhibited good performance. Sample 977 exhibited the highest performance, and comparison with the original surrogate (sample 810) demonstrated significant improvements in critical areas, emphasizing the efficacy of the refined composition. The study identified a silicone composition that directly addresses the feedback received by our team’s original silicone surrogate.

Computational mechanobiology model evaluating healing of postoperative cavities following breast-conserving surgery,Harbin Z.; Sohutskay D.; Vanderlaan E.; Fontaine M.; Mendenhall C.; Fisher C.; Voytik-Harbin S.; Tepole A.B.,2023,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107342,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer type worldwide. Given high survivorship, increased focus has been placed on long-term treatment outcomes and patient quality of life. While breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is the preferred treatment strategy for early-stage breast cancer, anticipated healing and breast deformation (cosmetic) outcomes weigh heavily on surgeon and patient selection between BCS and more aggressive mastectomy procedures. Unfortunately, surgical outcomes following BCS are difficult to predict, owing to the complexity of the tissue repair process and significant patient-to-patient variability. To overcome this challenge, we developed a predictive computational mechanobiological model that simulates breast healing and deformation following BCS. The coupled biochemical-biomechanical model incorporates multi-scale cell and tissue mechanics, including collagen deposition and remodeling, collagen-dependent cell migration and contractility, and tissue plastic deformation. Available human clinical data evaluating cavity contraction and histopathological data from an experimental porcine lumpectomy study were used for model calibration. The computational model was successfully fit to data by optimizing biochemical and mechanobiological parameters through Gaussian process surrogates. The calibrated model was then applied to define key mechanobiological parameters and relationships influencing healing and breast deformation outcomes. Variability in patient characteristics including cavity-to-breast volume percentage and breast composition were further evaluated to determine effects on cavity contraction and breast cosmetic outcomes, with simulation outcomes aligning well with previously reported human studies. The proposed model has the potential to assist surgeons and their patients in developing and discussing individualized treatment plans that lead to more satisfying post-surgical outcomes and improved quality of life. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,

Aims: In this paper, we propose a novel microsurgery robot using the dual delta structure (DDS) to mechanically scale the motion to seamlessly adjust between precise and larger motion. Materials & Methods: The DDS forms a lever mechanism that enables the motion scaling at the end-effector using two delta platforms.

This is due to the three-dimensional loss of bone, which limits the possibility for accurate anatomic reduction.

The biomechanical performance was validated through finite element analysis (FEA) and biomechanical tests. The tibia with inhomogeneous material properties was reconstructed according to computed tomography images, and different components were designed to simulate the operation. Minimum compliance TO subject to a volume fraction constraint combined with a graded lattice structure was utilized to redesign the prosthesis. FEA was performed to evaluate the mechanical performances of the tibia and implants after optimization, including stress, micromotion, and strain energy. The results were analyzed by paired-samples t tests, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Biomechanical testing was used to verify the tibial stresses.

Conversely, the stress and strain energy on the tibia increased in the TOG. The maximum von Mises stress values were 16.4 MPa in the OG and 22.9 MPa in the TOG with a 39.6% increase (p < 0.05), and the maximum SED value was 0.026 MPa in the OG and 0.042 MPa in the TOG, corresponding to an increase of 61.5% (p < 0.05). The maximum micromotions in the distal end of the stem were 135 μm in the OG and 68 μm in the TOG, almost a 50% reduction. The stress curves of the biomechanical test coincided well with the FEA results. The TO approach can effectively reduce the whole weight of the prosthesis and improve the biomechanical environment of the tibia. It could also pave the way for next-generation applications in orthopedics surgery. © 2020, Zhejiang University Press.",FALSE,
Manufacturing of customized implants for orbital fractures using 3D printing,A M.; Mohan A A.; Reddy M H.,2021,Bioprinting,10.1016/j.bprint.2020.e00118,"An orbital fracture is a traumatic injury to the bone in the eye socket. These fractures modify the orbital bone dimensions and the functioning of the intraorbital contents. In this study, a surgical method that includes positioning, aligning and fixing implants to restore orbital fractures was adapted. Notably, it is difficult to achieve an original three-dimensional orbital shape through the process of forming and cutting implants; however, this problem was solved by creating customized implants using computed tomography (CT) images of the patient. The objective of this work is to reconstruct the damaged orbital floor defects by means of a 3D printed implant and restore the orbital floor to its original shape. A case study of an orbital fracture has been included in this study. CT images were used to create a computer-aided design (CAD) model of orbital floor implants, which were designed to maintain orbital floor symmetry from right to left and vice versa. Furthermore, the designed implants were manufactured through a material extrusion process with biocompatible material. The application of the material extrusion process with biocompatible material resulted in the fabrication of implants at a minimal cost. Therefore, the customized models used in the patient's intra-operation can minimize the operational time and maximize surgical safety. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",FALSE,
Data-driven tissue mechanics with polyconvex neural ordinary differential equations,Tac V.; Sahli Costabal F.; Tepole A.B.,2022,Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering,10.1016/j.cma.2022.115248,"Data-driven methods are becoming an essential part of computational mechanics due to their advantages over traditional material modeling. Deep neural networks are able to learn complex material response without the constraints of closed-form models. However, data-driven approaches do not a priori satisfy physics-based mathematical requirements such as polyconvexity, a condition needed for the existence of minimizers for boundary value problems in elasticity. In this study, we use a recent class of neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), to develop data-driven material models that automatically satisfy polyconvexity of the strain energy. We take advantage of the properties of ordinary differential equations to create monotonic functions that approximate the derivatives of the strain energy with respect to deformation invariants. The monotonicity of the derivatives guarantees the convexity of the energy. The N-ODE material model is able to capture synthetic data generated from closed-form material models, and it outperforms conventional models when tested against experimental data on skin, a highly nonlinear and anisotropic material. We also showcase the use of the N-ODE material model in finite element simulations of reconstructive surgery. The framework is general and can be used to model a large class of materials, especially biological soft tissues. We therefore expect our methodology to further enable data-driven methods in computational mechanics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",FALSE,
In silico comparative biomechanical analysis of oblique and chevron medial displacement calcaneal osteotomies for pes planus deformity,Subasi O.; Sharma S.; Karaismailoglu B.; Hresko A.; Waryasz G.; Ashkani-Esfahani S.; Bejarano-Pineda L.,2024,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.107945,"Background: Medializing displacement calcaneal osteotomy is commonly performed as part of reconstructive surgery for patients with valgus hindfoot and progressive pes planus deformity. Among several types of calcaneal osteotomies, the oblique and Chevron osteotomy patterns have been commonly described in the literature and gained popularity as they are easily reproducible through percutaneous techniques. Currently, there is scarce evidence in the literature on which cut pattern is superior in terms of stability. To investigate the impact of cut pattern and posterior fragment medialization level on foot biomechanics, computational methods are employed. Methods: Ankle weightbearing computer tomography (CT) scans of seven patients diagnosed with stage II pes planus deformity are segmented and converted into 3D computational models. Oblique and Chevron osteotomy patterns are modeled independently for each patient. The posterior fragments are medially translated by 8-, 10- and 12-mm and subsequently fixated to the anterior calcaneus with two screws. A total of 42 models are exported to finite element software for biomechanical simulations. Among the investigated parameters, the higher stiffness and lower von Mises stress at the osteotomy interface and the screw site are assumed to be precursors of better stability. Results: It is recorded that as the medialization level increases, the stiffness decreases, and overall stresses increase. Also, it is observed that the Chevron cut produces a stiffer construct while the overall stresses are lower, indicating better stability when compared to the oblique cut. The statistical comparisons of the relevant groups that support these trends are found to be significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Chevron osteotomy showed superior stability compared to the oblique osteotomy while underscoring the negative impact of increased medialization of the posterior fragment. Clinical relevance: Opting for a lower medialization level and implementing the Chevron technique may facilitate union and earlier weightbearing. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,
Improving reconstructive surgery design using Gaussian process surrogates to capture material behavior uncertainty,Stowers C.; Lee T.; Bilionis I.; Gosain A.K.; Tepole A.B.,2021,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104340,"To produce functional, aesthetically natural results, reconstructive surgeries must be planned to minimize stress as excessive loads near wounds have been shown to produce pathological scarring and other complications (Gurtner et al., 2011). Presently, stress cannot easily be measured in the operating room. Consequently, surgeons rely on intuition and experience (Paul et al., 2016; Buchanan et al., 2016). Predictive computational tools are ideal candidates for surgery planning. Finite element (FE) simulations have shown promise in predicting stress fields on large skin patches and in complex cases, helping to identify potential regions of complication. Unfortunately, these simulations are computationally expensive and deterministic (Lee et al., 2018a). However, running a few, well selected FE simulations allows us to create Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models of local cutaneous flaps that are computationally efficient and able to predict stress and strain for arbitrary material parameters. Here, we create GP surrogates for the advancement, rotation, and transposition flaps. We then use the predictive capability of these surrogates to perform a global sensitivity analysis, ultimately showing that fiber direction has the most significant impact on strain field variations. We then perform an optimization to determine the optimal fiber direction for each flap for three different objectives driven by clinical guidelines (Leedy et al., 2005; Rohrer and Bhatia, 2005). While material properties are not controlled by the surgeon and are actually a source of uncertainty, the surgeon can in fact control the orientation of the flap with respect to the skin's relaxed tension lines, which are associated with the underlying fiber orientation (Borges, 1984). Therefore, fiber direction is the only material parameter that can be optimized clinically. The optimization task relies on the efficiency of the GP surrogates to calculate the expected cost of different strategies when the uncertainty of other material parameters is included. We propose optimal flap orientations for the three cost functions and that can help in reducing stress resulting from the surgery and ultimately reduce complications associated with excessive mechanical loading near wounds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,
"3D-printing of the elbow in complex posttraumatic elbow-stiffness for preoperative planning, surgery-simulation and postoperative control",Grunert R.; Winkler D.; Frank F.; Moebius R.; Kropla F.; Meixensberger J.; Hepp P.; Elze M.,2023,3D Printing in Medicine,10.1186/s41205-023-00191-x,"Background: Restoration of mobility of the elbow after post-traumatic elbow stiffening due to osteophytes is often a problem. Methods: The anatomical structures were segmented within the CT-scan. Afterwards, the Multi Jet Fusion 3D-printing was applied to create the model made of biocompatible and steam-sterilizable plastic. Preoperative simulation of osteophyte resection at the 3D-model was performed as well as the direct comparison with the patient anatomy intraoperatively. Results: The patient-specific was very helpful for the preoperative simulation of the resection of elbow osteophytes. The 3D anatomical representation improved the preoperative plan its implementation. A high degree of fidelity was found between the 3D Printed Anatomical representation and the actual joint pathology. Conclusions: Arthrolysis of complex post-traumatic bony changes is an important indication for the use of 3D models for preoperative planning.

A taper-fit junction to improve long bone reconstruction: A parametric In Silico model,Schileo E.; Feltri P.; Taddei F.; di Settimi M.; Di Martino A.; Filardo G.,2021,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104790,"Purpose: Critical size long bone defects represent a clinical challenge in orthopaedic surgery. Various grafting techniques have been developed through the years, but they all present several downsides. A key requirement of all grafting techniques is the achievement of a continuous interface between host bone and graft to enhance both biological processes and mechanical stability. This study used a parametric in silico model to quantify the biomechanical effect of the inaccuracies inherent to current osteotomy techniques, and to test a new concept of accurate taper-fit junction that may improve the biomechanical parameters of the reconstruction under load. Methods: A population-based in-silico 3D model of the reconstruction of a long bone defect was built to represent a defect of the femoral mid-diaphysis. To fix the reconstruction a titanium plate was placed on the lateral aspect of the reconstruction. The model was modified to (i) quantify the biomechanical consequences of actual inaccuracies in the realization of a flat host-graft interface, (ii) compare the contact behaviour and bone strains among different taper angles of the new design and the current host-graft flat interface, (iii) evaluate the robustness of the taper-fit design to inter-subject variability in bone geometry and defect length. Results: The influence of 2° single-plane misalignments of the host-graft interface is highly dependent on the misalignment orientation with respect to the metal plate. For some misalignment orientations, tangential micromotions of contact interfaces exceeded alert thresholds. When the angle of the taper-fit host-graft junction is changed from 10° to 30° and the results obtained are compared with the planar case, the overall stiffness is almost preserved, the bone strains are almost unchanged with safety factors higher than five, and full contact closure around the host-graft junction is achieved at 20°. Similarly, contact pressures decrease almost linearly with a 20% decrease at 30°. The host-graft micro motions are almost unchanged in both value and distribution up to 20° and never exceed the warning threshold of 50 μm. Conclusions: The present in silico study developed quantitative biomechanical evidence that an osteotomy performed with attention to the perpendicularity of the cut planes is needed to reduce the risk of mismatch and possible complications of long bone reconstructions, and that a new concept of a taper-fit junction may improve the biomechanical environment of the interface between the graft and the host bone. The optimal taper-fit configuration is suggested to be around a 20° taper angle. These results will serve as an input to conduct ex vivo experiments to further corroborate the proposed taper-fit junction concept and to refine its surgical implementation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,
A novel three dimensional-printed biomechanically evaluated patient-specific sacral implant in spinopelvic reconstruction after total en bloc sacrectomy,Lv Z.; Li J.; Yang Z.; Li X.; Yang Q.; Li Z.,2023,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2023.1153801,"Background: Reconstruction after a total sacrectomy is a challenge due to the special anatomical and biomechanical factors. Conventional techniques of spinal-pelvic reconstruction do not reconstruct satisfactorily. We describe a novel three-dimensional-printed patient-specific sacral implant in spinopelvic reconstruction after total en bloc sacrectomy. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study including 12 patients with primary malignant sacral tumors, including 5 men and 7 women with a mean age of 58.25 years (range 20–66 years), undergoing total en bloc sacrectomy with 3D printed implant reconstruction from 2016 to 2021. There were 7 cases of chordoma, 3 cases of osteosarcoma, 1 case of chondrosarcoma and 1 case of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. We use CAD technology to determine surgical resection boundaries, design cutting guides, and individualized prostheses, and perform surgical simulations before surgery. The implant design was biomechanically evaluated by finite element analysis. Operative data, oncological and functional outcomes, complications, and implant osseointegration status of 12 consecutive patients were reviewed. Results: The implants were implanted successfully in 12 cases without death or severe complications during the perioperative period. Resection margins were wide in 11 patients and marginal in one patient. The average blood loss was 3875 mL (range, 2000–5,000 mL). The average surgical time was 520 min (range, 380–735 min). The mean follow-up was 38.5 months. Nine patients were alive with no evidence of disease, two patients died due to pulmonary metastases, and one patient survived with disease due to local recurrence. Overall survival was 83.33% at 24 months. The Mean VAS was 1.5 (range, 0–2). The mean MSTS score was 21 (range, 17–24). Wound complications occurred in 2 cases. A deep infection occurred in one patient and the implant was removed. No implant mechanical failure was identified. Satisfactory osseointegration was found in all patients, with a mean fusion time of 5 months (range 3–6 months). Conclusion: The 3D-printed custom sacral prosthesis has been effective in reconstructing spinal-pelvic stability after total en bloc sacrectomy with satisfactory clinical outcomes, excellent osseointegration, and excellent durability.

Evaluation of the usability of a low-cost 3D printer in a tissue engineering approach for external ear reconstruction,Kuhlmann C.; Blum J.C.; Schenck T.L.; Giunta R.E.; Wiggenhauser P.S.,2021,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,10.3390/ijms222111667,"The use of alloplastic materials instead of autologous cartilage grafts offers a new perspective in craniofacial reconstructive surgery. Particularly for regenerative approaches, customized implants enable the surgeon to restore the cartilaginous framework of the ear without donor site morbidity. However, high development and production costs of commercially available implants impede clinical translation. For this reason, the usability of a low-cost 3D printer (Ultimaker 2+) as an inhouse-production tool for cheap surgical implants was investigated. The open software architecture of the 3D printer was modified in order to enable printing of biocompatible and biologically degradable polycaprolactone (PCL). Firstly, the printing accuracy and limitations of a PCL implant were compared to reference materials acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). Then the self-made PCL-scaffold was seeded with adipose-tissue derived stem cells (ASCs), and biocompatibility was compared to a commercially available PCL-scaffold using a cell viability staining (FDA/PI) and a dsDNA quantification assay (PicoGreen). Secondly, porous and solid patient-customized ear constructs were manufactured from mirrored CT-imagining data using a computer-assisted design (CAD) and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAM) approach to evaluate printing accuracy and reproducibility. The results show that printing of a porous PCL scaffolds was possible, with an accuracy equivalent to the reference materials at an edge length of 10 mm and a pore size of 0.67 mm. Cell viability, adhesion, and proliferation of the ASCs were equivalent on self-made and the commercially available PCL-scaffolds. Patient-customized ear constructs could be produced well in solid form and with limited accuracy in porous form from all three thermoplastic materials. Printing dimensions and quality of the modified low-cost 3D printer are sufficient for selected tissue engineering applications, and the manufacturing of personalized ear models for surgical simulation at manufacturing costs of EUR 0.04 per cell culture scaffold and EUR 0.90 (0.56) per solid (porous) ear construct made from PCL. Therefore, in-house production of PCL-based tissue engineering scaffolds and surgical implants should be further investigated to facilitate the use of new materials and 3D printing in daily clinical routine. © 2021 by the authors.

Incisions and wounds are introduced by element removal and the sutures are discretely modeled by applying linear constraint relations pairwise to groups of nodes. Two numerical examples utilize the closing of an elliptical wound to study the influence of the number of sutures and their location, and two test cases use the Z-plasty transposition flap technique to investigate the versatility of the proposed method and for comparison with state-of-the-art results. The results indicate that the presented method is able to recreate literature results to an acceptable level of accuracy. Further, the method proves versatile due to the ability to freely introduce incisions and wounds onto the fixed grid modeling domain without remeshing. Lastly, the two main advantages of the discrete suture representation are the ability to capture local stress concentrations near the sutures and the full freedom in placing the sutures. © 2024 The Author(s)",FALSE,

Bone stress relaxation in press-fit femoral knee implant fixation: A combined experimental and computational analysis,Gersie T.; Bitter T.; Freeman R.; Verdonschot N.; Janssen D.,2025,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2025.107067,"Aseptic loosening is the leading cause of revision in cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA), emphasizing the need for strong initial stability. Pre-clinical evaluations are essential for understanding implant fixation mechanics. Finite element (FE) models often rely on linear elastic bone material models, which inadequately represent bone behavior. Incorporating bone plasticity enhances predictions of primary stability, but may overestimate fixation by neglecting bone viscoelasticity and abrasion. Stress relaxation reduces press-fit forces, while bone abrasion weakens fixation strength. This study incorporated bone relaxation and abrasion into FE simulations of femoral TKA fixation and compared results to experimental measurements. Cadaveric femurs were implanted with femoral components, and strain gauges recorded outer surface strain over 24 h. A pull-off test evaluated fixation strength. FE models, using a plastic-viscoelastic bone material model, simulated these phases with varying levels of bone abrasion. The computational model without abrasion predicted implant strain 350 % higher than experimental measurements. 0.75 mm of virtual abrasion reduced overestimation to 150 %. Experimental strain reductions due to bone relaxation varied per reconstruction from 17 % to 37 %, while computational predictions were on average 41 % lower. Substantial variability was observed in both the experimental and simulated pull-off forces. Simulations without abrasion showed 180 %–360 % higher pull-off forces than the experiments. Including 0.5 mm of virtual abrasion reduced pull-off forces, aligning them more closely with experimental values, though 0.75 mm led to underestimation in some cases.

The synthetic implants are used for the reconstructive surgery of POP, but severe complications associated with their use have been reported, mainly related to their mechanical properties (e.g., implant stiffness) and microstructure. In this study, we mimicked a transvaginal reconstructive surgery to repair the apical ligaments (uterosacral ligaments (USLs) and cardinal ligaments (CLs)), by modeling, their impairment (90% and 50%) and/or total rupture. The implants to reinforce/replace these ligaments were built based on literature specifications and their mechanical properties were obtained through uniaxial tensile tests. The main aim of this study was to simulate the effect of mesh anchoring technique (simple stich and continuous stitch), and compare the displacement magnitude of the pelvic tissues, during Valsalva maneuver. The absence/presence of the synthetic implant was simulated when total rupture of the CLs and USLs occurs, causing a variation of the vaginal displacement (9% for the CLs and 27% for the USLs).

A Gaussian process approach for rapid evaluation of skin tension,Nagle M.; Conroy Broderick H.; Vedel C.; Destrade M.; Fop M.; Ní Annaidh A.,2024,Acta Biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2024.05.025,"Skin tension plays a pivotal role in clinical settings, it affects scarring, wound healing and skin necrosis. Despite its importance, there is no widely accepted method for assessing in vivo skin tension or its natural pre-stretch. This study aims to utilise modern machine learning (ML) methods to develop a model that uses non-invasive measurements of surface wave speed to predict clinically useful skin properties such as stress and natural pre-stretch. A large dataset consisting of simulated wave propagation experiments was created using a simplified two-dimensional finite element (FE) model. Using this dataset, a sensitivity analysis was performed, highlighting the effect of the material parameters and material model on the Rayleigh and supersonic shear wave speeds. Then, a Gaussian process regression model was trained to solve the ill-posed inverse problem of predicting stress and pre-stretch of skin using measurements of surface wave speed. This model had good predictive performance (R2 = 0.9570) and it was possible to interpolate simplified parametric equations to calculate the stress and pre-stretch. To demonstrate that wave speed measurements could be obtained cheaply and easily, a simple experiment was devised to obtain wave speed measurements from synthetic skin at different values of pre-stretch. These experimental wave speeds agree well with the FE simulations, and a model trained solely on the FE data provided accurate predictions of synthetic skin stiffness. Both the simulated and experimental results provide further evidence that elastic wave measurements coupled with ML models are a viable non-invasive method to determine in vivo skin tension. Statement of significance: To prevent unfavourable patient outcomes from reconstructive surgery, it is necessary to determine relevant subject-specific skin properties. For example, during a skin graft, it is necessary to estimate the pre-stretch of the skin to account for shrinkage upon excision. Existing methods are invasive or rely on the experience of the clinician. Our work aims to present an innovative framework to non-invasively determine in vivo material properties using the speed of a surface wave travelling through the skin.

Due to the limitation of fabricating screw hole threads in the PSMRP, 3D printed PSMRP is applied to the non-locking system directly in the mandibular reconstruction with bone graft regardless of the locking system. Since the conventional manual-bending reconstruction plate (CMBRP) provides better fixation in the locking system, it needs to be validated whether the locking PSMRP performs better than the non-locking PSMRP in the patient-specific mandibular reconstruction. Thereupon, the purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical behavior between the locking and non-locking PSMRP. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to conduct the biomechanical comparison between the locking PSMRP and non-locking PSMRP by simulating the momentary incisal clenching through static structural analysis. Mandible was reconstructed through the virtual surgical planning, and subsequently a 3D model of mandibular reconstruction assembly, including reconstructed mandible, PSMRP, and fixation screws, was generated and meshed for the following FEA simulations. In the form of equivalent von Mises stress, equivalent elastic strain, and total deformation, the locking PSMRP demonstrated its higher strengths of preferable safety, desirable flexibility, and anticipated stability compared with the non-locking PSMRP, indicated by much lower maximum stress, lower maximum strain and equivalent displacement. Locking PSMRP/screw system provides a better fixation effect to the patient-specific mandibular reconstruction than the non-locking one as a result of its productive fixation nature.

Monosaccharide-mediated rational synthesis of a universal plasmonic platform with broad spectral fluorescence enhancement for high-sensitivity cancer biomarker analysis,Liu M.; Li Y.; Xing W.; Zhang Y.; Xie X.; Pang J.; Zhou F.; Yang J.,2022,Journal of Nanobiotechnology,10.1186/s12951-022-01359-z,"Background: Effective and accurate screening of oncological biomarkers in peripheral blood circulation plays an increasingly vital role in diagnosis and prognosis. High-sensitivity assays can effectively aid clinical decision-making and intervene in cancer in a localized status before they metastasize and become unmanageable. Meanwhile, it is equally pivotal to prevent overdiagnosis of non-life-threatening cancer by eliminating unnecessary treatment and repeated blood draws. Unfortunately, current clinical screening methodologies can hardly simultaneously attain sufficient sensitivity and specificity, especially under resource-restrained circumstances. To circumvent such limitations, particularly for cancer biomarkers from early-onset and recurrence, we aim to develop a universal plasmonic platform for clinical applications, which macroscopically amplifies multiplexed fluorescence signals in a broad spectral window and readily adapts to current assay setups without sophisticated accessories or expertise at low cost. Methods: The plasmonic substrate was chemically synthesized in situ at the solid–liquid interface by rationally screening a panel of reducing monosaccharides and tuning the redox reactions at various catalyst densities and precursor concentrations. The redox properties were studied by Benedict’s assay and electrochemistry. We systemically characterized the morphologies and optical properties of the engineered plasmonic Ag structures by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectroscopy. The structure-fluorescence enhancement correlation was explicitly explained by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and a computational model for gap distribution. Next, we established an enhanced fluoroimmunoassay (eFIA) using a model biomarker for prostate cancer (PCa) and validated it in healthy and PCa cohorts. Prognosis was explored in patients subject to surgical and hormonal interventions following recommended PCa guidelines. Results: The monosaccharide-mediated redox reaction yielded a broad category of Ag structures, including sparsely dispersed nanoparticles (NPs) of various sizes, semi-continuous nanoislands, and crackless continuous films. Optimal broad-spectral fluorescence enhancement from green to far-red was observed for the inhomogeneous, irregularly-shaped semi-continuous Ag nanoisland substrate (AgNIS), synthesized from a well-balanced redox reaction at a stable rate mediated by mannose. In addition, different local electric field intensity distributions in response to various incident excitations were observed at the nanoscale, elucidating the need for irregular and inhomogeneous structures. AgNIS enabled a maximized 54.7-fold macroscopically amplified fluorescence and long-lasting photostability. Point-of-care availability was fulfilled using a customized smartphone prototype with well-paired optics. The eFIA effectively detected the PCa marker in cell lines, xenograft tumors, and patient sera. The plasmonic platform rendered a diagnostic sensitivity of 86.0% and a specificity of 94.7% and capably staged high-grade PCa that the clinical gold standard test failed to stratify. Patient prognosis of robotic-assisted surgeries and hormone therapies was non-invasively monitored following efficient medical interventions. The assay time was significantly curtailed on the plasmonic platform upon microwave irradiation. Conclusions: By investigating the effects of reducing monosaccharides on the seed-mediated chemical synthesis of plasmonic Ag structures, we deduced that potent multiplexed fluorescence enhancement originated from both an adequate reducing power and a steady reduction rate.

Optimization of grinding parameters in robotic-assisted preparation of cracked teeth based on fracture mechanics: FEA and experiment,Sun J.; Jiang J.; Ma B.; Zhang Y.; Pan J.; Qiao D.,2025,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108485,"Background and Objectives: If left untreated, cracked teeth can lead to tooth loss, of which the incidence is 70%. Dental preparation is an effective treatment, but it is difficult to meet the clinical requirements when traditionally prepared by dentists. Grinding-based tooth preparation robot (TPR) shows promise for clinical applications to assist dentists. However, current TPR has problems with chipping and crack extension when preparing real teeth. Methods: We propose a grinding parameter optimization strategy to solve this problem, specifically including preparation depth and direction. Among them, surface morphology observation technology and thermal-mechanical coupling simulation technology are used. Through theoretical modeling, computer simulation techniques and surface morphology experimental studies, different motion parameters are compared and analyzed to derive the optimal preparation parameters. Results: One of our contributions is to control the preparation depth based on the different material removal methods, and the brittle removal methods and grinding heat during the preparation process were reduced. Another contribution is to derive the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip for different preparation directions based on multi-grit and thermal-mechanical coupling finite element model for different preparation stages. The preparation direction was directed and crack extension was minimized. Finally, the experimental system of the TPR was constructed. Based on the proposed morphology and preparation direction optimization method, the material removal method during the preparation process can be controlled in plastic removal. Crack extension was also reduced based on different stages of optimized preparation directions. Based on the guided strategy, the TPR can provide safe assisted dentists. Conclusions: In this work, the preparation parameters of the cracked preparation robot were optimized to enable it to perform the preparation of hard and brittle cracked teeth. The surface morphology met the clinical requirements. Intraoral preparation will be considered in the future to advance the robot toward clinical dental applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",FALSE,

Identified trends showed statistical significance when setting the AirSeal® System to Low smoke evacuation that it reduces the percentage of particulate matter at the Access Port opening. Additionally, it was observed that when utilising a laparoscopic tool a similar trend in particle distributions were seen between either insufflation and access system at the opening of the Access Port and trocar. Evacuation times for SSPM removal within the AirSeal® System showed an overall average to ≥95% reduction of 5.64 min within the surgical cavity, 3.69 min at the Access Port opening, and 3.61 min within the smoke evacuation line. The overall average for the traditional insufflation and access system was 9.38 min within the surgical cavity and 6.06 min at the trocar opening.

Modeling and experimental study of the needle indentation into a brain phantom,Yakovenko A.A.; Lai Y.-X.; Goryacheva I.G.; Ju M.-S.; Dosaev M.Z.; Selyutskiy Y.D.,2021,International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics,10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2021.103832,"In some surgical operations, a needle is inserted into the patient's brain to perform the necessary manipulations (for instance, a biopsy). In this context, the study of the interaction between the needle and the brain tissue is an important task. One of common ways to perform experimental study of such interaction is through the use brain phantoms. In this work, a series of experiments is performed on indentation of a biopsy needle into a phantom manufactured of the agar gel. During these experiments, the force of interaction between the needle and the phantom tissue was measured for different indentation speeds and depths. An analytical mathematical model is proposed that describes this force. The model takes into account such effects as viscoelastic and plastic properties and relaxation behavior of the material, as well as the presence of a surface film. Parameters of the model are identified based on the obtained experimental data. It is shown that the results of numerical simulation using this model are in good agreement with the experimental data. Such a model is general and can be used not only for solving problems of biomechanics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,
Influence of Prestretch on Planar Indentation of Elastomers: Insights from Experiments and Theory,Wu S.; Zheng Y.L.,2025,Journal of Applied Mechanics,10.1115/1.4067149,"Elastomers exhibit a stiffer mechanical response and anisotropy when stretched in a specific direction, which has led to numerous applications in biomechanics, surgery, tactile sensors, and more. This study introduces a comprehensive, experimentally validated analytical framework to investigate the effects of prestretch on the planar contact between a rigid indenter and a hyperelastic substrate. By linearizing the equilibrium equation for incremental deformation, we adapt the superposition principle to reveal how prestretch modifies the mechanical response, which is reflected in a simple prefactor in the surface Green's function. This modification facilitates precise calculation of contact mechanics properties, including indentation pressure distributions and displacement profiles, which are essential for assessing both global and local properties, e.g., force-displacement responses. We further support our theoretical findings with numerical simulations and validate them through cylindrical indentation tests across various stretch ratios. These outcomes emphasize the feasibility of using our first-order approximation theory in practical settings, especially for the mechanical characterization of materials involving residual stress analysis and the development of advanced, model-based adaptive tactile sensors.

Biomechanical analysis and design method for patient-specific reconstructive implants for large bone defects of the distal lateral femur,Wu P.-K.; Lee C.-W.; Sun W.-H.; Lin C.-L.,2022,Biosensors,10.3390/bios12010004,"This study aims to develop a generalizable method for designing a patient-specific reconstructive scaffold implant for a large distal lateral femur defect using finite element (FE) analysis and topology optimization. A 3D solid-core implant for the distal femur defect was designed to withhold the femur load. Data from FE analysis of the solid implant were used for topology optimization to obtain a ‘bone scaffold implant’ with light-weight internal cavity and surface lattice features to allow for filling with bone material. The bone scaffold implant weighed 69.6% less than the original solid-core implant. The results of FE simulation show that the bone repaired with the bone scaffold implant had lower total displacement (12%), bone plate von Mises stress (34%), bone maximum first principal stress (33%), and bone maximum first principal strain (32%) than did bone repaired with bone cement. The trend in experimental strain with increasing load on the composite femur was greater with bone cement than with the bone scaffold implant.

Transpositions of skin flaps during surgery procedures are here computationally described by a general mapping technique of the internal boundary corresponding to surgery cut.

Bayesian calibration of a computational model of tissue expansion based on a porcine animal model,Han T.; Lee T.; Ledwon J.; Vaca E.; Turin S.; Kearney A.; Gosain A.K.; Tepole A.B.,2022,Acta Biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2021.10.007,"Tissue expansion is a technique used clinically to grow skin in situ to correct large defects. Despite its enormous potential, lack of fundamental knowledge of skin adaptation to mechanical cues, and lack of predictive computational models limit the broader adoption and efficacy of tissue expansion. In our previous work, we introduced a finite element model of tissue expansion that predicted key patterns of strain and growth which were then confirmed by our porcine animal model. Here we use the data from a new set of experiments to calibrate the computational model within a Bayesian framework. Four 10×10 cm2 patches were tattooed in the dorsal skin of four 12 weeks-old minipigs and a total of six patches underwent successful tissue expander placement and inflation to 60cc for expansion times ranging from 1 h to 7 days. Six patches that did not have expanders implanted served as controls for the analysis. We find that growth can be explained based on the elastic deformation. The predicted area growth rate is k∈[0.02,0.08] [h−1]. Growth is anisotropic and reflects the anisotropic mechanical behavior of porcine dorsal skin. The rostral-caudal axis shows greater deformation than the transverse axis, and the time scale of growth in the rostral-caudal direction is given by rate parameters k1∈[0.04,0.1] [h−1] compared to k2∈[0.01,0.05] [h−1] in the transverse direction. Moreover, the calibration results underscore the high variability in biological systems, and the need to create probabilistic computational models to predict tissue adaptation in realistic settings. Statement of significance: Tissue expansion is a widely used technique in reconstructive surgery because it triggers growth of skin for the correction of large skin lesions and for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Despite of its potential, complications and undesired outcomes persist due to our incomplete understanding of skin mechanobiology. Here we quantify the deformation and growth fields induced by an expander over 7 days in a porcine animal model and use these data to calibrate a computational model of skin growth using finite element simulations and a Bayesian framework. The calibrated model is a leap forward in our understanding skin growth, we now have quantitative understanding of this process: area growth is anisotropic and it is proportional to stretch with a characteristic rate constant of k∈[0.02,0.08] [h−1]. © 2021 Acta Materialia Inc.",FALSE,

Subjective scar assessment scales in orthopaedic surgery and determinants of patient satisfaction: a systematic review of the literature,"Lastoria, Diego A Abelleyra and Benny, Clerin K and Hing, Caroline B",2023,Chinese Journal of Traumatology,Elsevier,"Background: Scars are an inevitable consequence of surgery and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Subjective scar assessment scales are commonly used in orthopaedic surgery to evaluate scar appearance and patient satisfaction. This systematic review aims to summarize the available subjective scar assessment scales used in orthopaedic surgery and identify determinants of patient satisfaction with surgical scars.  Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in multiple databases to identify studies that utilized subjective scar assessment scales in orthopaedic surgery and reported on factors influencing patient satisfaction. Data on the types of scales used, their psychometric properties, and determinants of satisfaction were extracted and analyzed.  Results: Several subjective scar assessment scales were identified, including the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), and others. These scales vary in their focus on scar characteristics such as color, texture, and thickness, as well as patient-reported outcomes. Determinants of patient satisfaction included scar visibility, location, symptoms (e.g., pain, itching), and psychological impact. The POSAS was frequently used and demonstrated good reliability and validity.  Conclusions: Subjective scar assessment scales are valuable tools in orthopaedic surgery for evaluating scar outcomes and patient satisfaction. Understanding the determinants of satisfaction can guide surgical techniques and postoperative care to improve patient-centered outcomes.

This study aimed to characterize the radiomic features of malignant prostate lesions based on multi-paramagnetic magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Methods: We analyzed 20 patients who underwent mpMRI followed by radical prostatectomy. Two experienced radiologists manually segmented the 3D lesions using the T2-weighted (T2WI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) imaging sequences. A total of 210 radiomic features were extracted from each lesion. We used the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation to select key features.

In developing an adequate model to utilize in simulation, 3D printing has emerged as a useful technology to provide detailed, accessible, and high-fidelity models. Nasal osteotomy is an essential step in many rhinoplasty surgeries, yet it can be challenging to perform and difficult to receive adequate exposure to this nuanced portion of the procedure. As it currently stands, there are limited opportunities to practice nasal osteotomy due to the reliance on cadaveric bones, which are expensive, difficult to obtain, and require appropriate facilities and personnel. While previous designs have been developed, these models leave room for improvement in printing efficiency, cost, and material performance. This manuscript aims to describe the methodology for the design of an updated nasal osteotomy training model derived from anatomic data and optimized for printability, usability, and fidelity. Additionally, an analysis of multiple commercially available 3D printing materials and technologies was conducted to determine which offered superior equivalency to bone. Methods: This model was updated from a first-generation model previously described to include a more usable base and form, reduce irrelevant structures, and optimize geometry for 3D printing, while maintaining the nasal bones with added stabilizers essential for function and fidelity. For the material comparison, this updated model was printed in five materials: Ultimaker Polylactic Acid, 3D Printlife ALGA, 3DXTECH SimuBone, FibreTuff, and FormLabs Durable V2. Facial plastic surgeons tested the models in a blinded, randomized fashion and completed surveys assessing tactile feedback, audio feedback, material limitation, and overall value.

Plastic hexahedral FEM for surgical simulation,Gao R.; Peters J.,2022,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-022-02742-9,"Purpose: Soft-tissue manipulations, such as collecting, stretching or tearing tissue, are a common component of surgery. When too much force is applied, these manipulations result in a residual plastic deformation that surgeons should be aware of and that should be modeled by surgical simulation. Methods: Many tissues, vessels and organs can be modeled as offsets of curved simple shapes with primary directions, e.g., radial and axial for cylinders yield a rectangular mesh whose normal offset naturally yields a hexahedral mesh that can serve as a thick shell. Other organs are easy to embed into and deform following a hex mesh. We extend existing code for the volumetric finite element method (FEM) to model tissue plasticity as hexahedral thick shells or embedded organs. Specifically, the work extends the open source Simulation Open Framework Architecture and its newest hyperelastic deformation addition, Caribou, with focus on surgical simulation. The extension factors deformation gradients into (corotational or hyperelastic) elastic factors and plastic factors and enforces volume preservation. Limits on per-element twist, twist torque, material hardening and bounds on plasticity where elements invert avoid the need for re-meshing. Results: Our hexahedral FEM avoids the biased outcomes of asymmetric coarsely-partitioned tetrahedral FEM. Caribou’s hyperelastic FEM is extended to hex-FEM stretching plasticity. Our high-order accurate blended-vertex deformation enables coarse hex meshes to model large plastic rotational and stretch deformations without re-meshing. We compare a vertex-blended to a cell-centered piecewise constant approach; contrast plasticity based on corotational FEM and hyperelastic FEM; and test the computation under mesh refinement. The volume is preserved also for large deformations. Conclusion: On-the-fly generated hexahedral meshes can directly be used as finite element domains for plastic deformation based on corotational or hyperelastic elasticity.

The method is rough, and the flaps cut often cannot match the wounds and affect their appearance. Computer-aided design technology helps to attain precise results in less time. This study proposes a skin wound morphological flattening algorithm based on hierarchical values. First, the skin wound is scanned by three-dimensional (3D) scanning technology to obtain a spatial mesh model consisting of triangular cells, and the mesh model is layered with a hierarchical value. Then, the layered mesh is topologically mapped to the plane. Subsequently, the stress and strain of the skin are simulated using a mechanical method, and the shape of the flattened skin wound is optimized layer by layer. Finally, the multiresolution smoothing technique is used to smooth the developed boundary contour and fit the curve to obtain a guidance plan for preoperative flap design. The results of the study showed that this method can accurately determine the shape of the skin wounds and quantitatively analyze the preoperative design results of the skin flaps.

Here, we propose the use of a Bone-Ligament-Bone (BLB) 3D-printed polyethylene terephthalate (PET) scaffold for achieving mechanical stabilisation of the scaphoid and lunate following SLIL rupture. The BLB scaffold featured two bone compartments bridged by aligned fibres (ligament compartment) mimicking the architecture of the native tissue. The scaffold presented tensile stiffness in the range of 260 ± 38 N/mm and ultimate load of 113 ± 13 N, which would support physiological loading. A finite element analysis (FEA), using inverse finite element analysis (iFEA) for material property identification, showed an adequate fit between simulation and experimental data. The scaffold was then biofunctionalized using two different methods: injected with a Gelatin Methacryloyl solution containing human mesenchymal stem cell spheroids (hMSC) or seeded with tendon-derived stem cells (TDSC) and placed in a bioreactor to undergo cyclic deformation. The first approach demonstrated high cell viability, as cells migrated out of the spheroid and colonised the interstitial space of the scaffold. These cells adopted an elongated morphology suggesting the internal architecture of the scaffold exerted topographical guidance. The second method demonstrated the high resilience of the scaffold to cyclic deformation and the secretion of a fibroblastic related protein was enhanced by the mechanical stimulation. This process promoted the expression of relevant proteins, such as Tenomodulin (TNMD), indicating mechanical stimulation may enhance cell differentiation and be useful prior to surgical implantation. In conclusion, the PET scaffold presented several promising characteristics for the immediate mechanical stabilisation of disassociated scaphoid and lunate and, in the longer-term, the regeneration of the ruptured SLIL. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",FALSE,
Multi-scale constitutive model of human trabecular bone,Jankowski K.; Pawlikowski M.; Domański J.,2023,Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics,10.1007/s00161-022-01161-0,"The present study aims to formulate a new multiscale constitutive model of human trabecular bone. The trabecular bone was modelled as a nonlinear viscoelastic material. The viscoelastic effects of single trabeculae were considered by means of a hereditary integral in which stress depends on time and strain, while the elastic response was described by the hyperelastic Mooney–Rivlin model. The cuboid bone sample was extracted from the femoral head during the hip replacement surgery. The material constants in the constitutive equation were identified based on the stress relaxation test performed on the cuboid sample and the microindentation tests performed on trabeculae using the curve-fitting procedure. The microindentation tests were performed using a spherical tip instead of Vickers or Berkovich tip to minimize plastic effects during trabecular deformation. In order to validate formulated constitutive model, results from a FE simulation of stress relaxation test and uniaxial compression test were compared to the results of the corresponding experiments conducted on a macroscopic bone sample. Good agreement was observed between numerical and experimental results. The viscoelastic behaviour predicted by the proposed constitutive equation corresponds well to the response of human trabecular bone under various types of load conditions. This demonstrates the high ability of our constitutive model to simulate the behaviour of trabecular bone on a micro- and macroscopic scale. Thus, we conclude that the model, which was formulated for a single trabecula, can be successfully applied to simulate mechanical behaviour of the tissue in a macroscale. © 2022, The Author(s).",TRUE,"Deals with bone modeling, not surgery outcomes."
Temperature Field Prediction of Variable Bone Milling Conditions Based on Thermal-Parameter Calibration and Finite-Element Simulation,Zhou Z.; Hu J.; Dai Y.; Zhang J.; Jiang Z.,2025,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,10.1109/TIM.2025.3554280,"Bone milling is a common surgical procedure widely used in dental, orthopedic, and plastic surgeries. Bone has low thermal conductivity and high specific heat. As a result, significant heat generated during bone milling tends to accumulate in the milling area, often leading to thermal necrosis. Currently, there are no suitable sensors available to monitor the temperature during bone milling, which forces surgeons to rely on their personal experience to determine if the temperature is too high. This article presented a temperature field prediction model for robot-assisted bone milling using finite-element techniques. This model can predict the temperature distribution under various milling conditions, providing a valuable reference for surgeons. In developing this model, the thermal parameters of the cortical bone and the convective heat transfer coefficient of the environment were unknown. In order to determine these parameters, a heat conduction experiment based on a point heat source was designed. The identified parameters were then used to build the temperature prediction model. Five sets of dry milling experiments with different milling angles and depths and one set of experiments with irrigation fluid added were performed using a 4-DOF robot to verify the model.

Skeletal muscle surrogates for the acquisition of muscle repair skills in upper limb surgery,Heskin L.; Galvin R.; Conroy J.; Traynor O.; Madden S.; Simms C.,2022,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105216,"Introduction: The required fidelity of synthetic materials in surgical simulators to teach tissue handling and repair requirements should be as accurate as possible. There is a poor understanding of the relationship between choice of muscle surrogates and training outcome for trainee surgeons. To address this, the mechanical characteristics of several candidate synthetic muscle surrogates were measured, and their subjective biofidelity was qualitatively assessed by surgeons. Methods: Silicone was selected after assessing several material options and 16 silicone-based surrogates were evaluated. Three of the closest samples to muscle (Samples 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) and one with inserted longitudinal fibres (1.2F) were mechanically tested in the following: compression and tension, needle puncture force and suture pull-out in comparison with real muscle. The four samples were evaluated by 17 Plastic and Orthopaedic surgeons to determine their views of the fidelity with regard to the handling properties, needle insertion and ease of suture pull-out. Results: The mechanical testing showed the surrogates exhibited varying characteristics that matched some of the properties of muscle, though none recreated all the mechanical characteristics of native muscle. Good biofidelity was generally achieved for compression stiffness and needle puncture force, but it was evident that tensile stiff was too low for all samples. The pull-out forces were variable and too low, except for the sample with longitudinal fibres. In the qualitative assessment, the overall median scores for the four surrogate samples were all between 30 and 32 (possible range 9–45), indicating limited differentiation of the samples tested by the surgeons. Conclusions: The surrogate materials showed a range of mechanical properties bracketing those of real muscle, thus presenting a suitable combination of candidates for use in simulators to attain the requirements as set out in the learning outcomes of muscle repair. However, despite significant mechanical differences between the samples, all surgeons found the samples to be similar to each other. © 2022",TRUE,"Focuses on surgical training tools, not on predicting or evaluating surgery results."

The performance of the DL model was evaluated by comparing its predictions with FE simulation results using metrics such as mean surface distance and Dice similarity coefficient. Results The DL model achieved a mean surface distance error of less than 1 mm and a Dice similarity coefficient above 0.9, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting facial tissue deformation. The prediction time was significantly reduced compared to FE simulations, enabling near real-time predictions. Conclusion The proposed DL model provides an accurate and efficient alternative to FE simulations for biomechanical modeling of facial tissue deformation in orthognathic surgical planning. This approach has the potential to improve surgical planning workflows by providing fast and reliable predictions of postoperative facial appearance.",FALSE,
Biomechanical design of a new percutaneous locked plate for comminuted proximal tibia fractures,Djuricic A.; Gee A.; Schemitsch E.H.; Quenneville C.E.; Zdero R.,2022,Medical Engineering and Physics,10.1016/j.medengphy.2022.103801,"Comminuted proximal tibia fractures are an ongoing surgical challenge. This “proof of concept” study is the first step in designing a new percutaneous plate for this injury under toe-touch weight-bearing as prescribed after surgery. Finite element simulations generated design curves for overall stiffness, bone and implant stress, and interfragmentary motion using 3 fixations (no, 1, or 2 “kickstand” (KS) screws across the fracture gap) over a range of plate elastic moduli (EP = 5 to 200 GPa). Combining well-established optimization criteria to enhance callus formation (i.e. 0.2 mm ≤ axial interfragmentary motion ≤ 1 mm; shear / axial interfragmentary motion ratio < 1.6), lessen stress shielding (i.e. bone stress under the proposed plate > bone stress under a traditional titanium or steel plate), and reduce steel screw breakage (i.e. screw max stress < ultimate tensile stress of steel) resulted in plate design recommendations: 172.6 ≤ EP < 200 GPa (no KS screw), 79.8 ≤ EP < 100 GPa (1 KS screw), and 4.9 ≤ EP < 100 GPa (2 KS screws).

The effect of bone relaxation on the simulated pull-off force of a cementless femoral knee implant,Gersie T.; Bitter T.; Freeman R.; Verdonschot N.; Janssen D.,2025,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2025.112528,"Aseptic loosening is the primary cause of revision in cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA), emphasizing the importance of strong initial stability for long-term implant success. Pre-clinical evaluations are crucial for understanding implant fixation mechanics and improving implant designs. Finite element (FE) analysis models often use linear elastic bone material models, which do not accurately reflect bone's mechanical behavior. Incorporating a von Mises yield model to simulate bone's plastic behavior improved predictions of primary stability but tends to overestimate fixation, potentially due to neglecting bone viscoelasticity. Stress relaxation in bone can affect primary stability by reducing press-fit forces on implants. This study aimed to include bone relaxation into FE models of femoral TKA reconstructions to investigate the impact of bone material models on primary fixation. Simulated pull-off tests were conducted using three material models: elastic, plastic, and plastic-viscoelastic. Six femoral reconstructions, previously used in another study, were included. The average pull-off force decreased (about 79%) from 31 kN with the elastic model to 6.3 kN when bone plasticity was included. Introducing stress relaxation showed a minimal effect, leading to an additional reduction in pull-off force of 0.8%. A significant positive correlation was found between bone mineral density and pull-off force across the three material models. Additionally, elastic strain energy within the femur correlated strongly with pull-off force, suggesting higher strain energy increases pull-off force. This study is the first to integrate plastic and viscoelastic bone behavior in FE simulations, offering insights into cementless implant fixation within context of realistic bone mechanics. © 2025 The Author(s)",FALSE,

This study evaluated the impact of the design and composition of commercially available collagen-based matrices on the observed vacuum pressure delivered under NPWT using a custom test apparatus. Specifically, testing compared the effect of the commercial products; ovine forestomach matrix (OFM), collagen/oxidized regenerated cellulose (collagen/ORC) and a collagen-based dressing (CWD) on the observed vacuum pressure. OFM resulted in an ∼50% reduction in the observed target vacuum pressure at 75 mmHg and 125 mmHg, however, this effect was mitigated to a ∼0% reduction when fenestrations were introduced into the matrix. Both collagen/ORC and CWD reduced the observed vacuum pressure at 125 mmHg (∼15% and ∼50%, respectively), and this was more dramatic when a lower vacuum pressure of 75 mmHg was delivered (∼20% and ∼75%, respectively). The reduced performance of the reconstituted collagen products is thought to result from the gelling properties of these products that may cause occlusion of the delivered vacuum to the wound bed. These findings highlight the importance of in vitro testing to establish the impact of adjunctive therapies on NPWT, where effective delivery of vacuum pressure is paramount to the efficacy of this therapy. © 2022 Aroa Biosurgery Limited, New Zealand",FALSE,
Experimental analysis and numerical fatigue life prediction of 3D-Printed osteosynthesis plates,Nakhaei M.; Sterba M.; Foletti J.-M.; Badih L.; Behr M.,2023,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2023.1133869,"The trend towards patient-specific medical orthopedic prostheses has led to an increased use of 3D-printed surgical implants made of Ti6Al4V. However, uncertainties arise due to varying printing parameters, particularly with regards to the fatigue limit. This necessitates time-consuming and costly experimental validation before they can be safely used on patients. To address this issue, this study aimed to employ a stress-life fatigue analysis approach coupled with a finite element (FE) simulation to estimate numerically the fatigue limit and location of failure for 3D-printed surgical osteosynthesis plates and to validate the results experimentally. However, predicting the fatigue life of 3D components is not a new concept and has previously been implemented in the medical device field, though without experimental validation. Then, an experimental fatigue test was conducted using a proposed modification to the staircase method introduced in ISO 12107. Additionally, a FE model was developed to estimate the stress cycles on the plate. The stress versus number of cycles to failure curve (S-N) obtained from the minimum mechanical properties of 3D-printed Ti6AI4V alloy according to ASTM F3001-14 to predict the fatigue limit. The comparison between experimental results and fatigue numerical predictions showed very good agreement. It was found that a linear elastic FE model was sufficient to estimate the fatigue limit, while an elastic-plastic model led to an accurate prediction throughout the implant’s cyclic life. The proposed method has great potential for enhancing patient-specific implant designs without the need for time-consuming and costly experimental regulatory testing.

This study aimed to create a machine-learning prediction model for 30-day mortality after a non-cardiac surgery that adapts to the manageable amount of clinical information as input features and is validated against multi-centered rather than single-centered data. Data were collected from 454,404 patients over 18 years of age who underwent non-cardiac surgeries from four independent institutions. We performed a retrospective analysis of the retrieved data. Only 12–18 clinical variables were used for model training. Logistic regression, random forest classifier, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural network methods were applied to compare the prediction performances. To reduce overfitting and create a robust model, bootstrapping and grid search with tenfold cross-validation were performed.

Unsupervised generative model for simulating post-operative double eyelid image,Wu R.; Liao S.; Dai P.; Han F.; Kui X.; Song X.,2025,Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine,10.1007/s13246-024-01488-9,"Simulating the outcome of double eyelid surgery is a challenging task. Many existing approaches rely on complex and time-consuming 3D digital models to reconstruct facial features for simulating facial plastic surgery outcomes. Some recent research performed a simple affine transformation approach based on 2D images to simulate double eyelid surgery outcomes. However, these methods have faced challenges, such as generating unnatural simulation outcomes and requiring manual removal of masks from images. To address these issues, we have pioneered the use of an unsupervised generative model to generate post-operative double eyelid images. Firstly, we created a dataset involving pre- and post-operative 2D images of double eyelid surgery. Secondly, we proposed a novel attention-class activation map module, which was embedded in a generative adversarial model to facilitate translating a single eyelid image to a double eyelid image. This innovative module enables the generator to selectively focus on the eyelid region that differentiates between the source and target domain, while enhancing the discriminator’s ability to discern differences between real and generated images. Finally, we have adjusted the adversarial consistency loss to guide the generator in preserving essential features from the source image and eliminating any masks when generating the double eyelid image.

Computational modeling of vascular growth in patient-specific pulmonary arterial patch reconstructions,Lashkarinia S.S.; Coban G.; Kose B.; Salihoglu E.; Pekkan K.,2021,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110274,"Recent progress in vascular growth mechanics has involved the use of computational algorithms to address clinical problems with the use of three-dimensional patient specific geometries. The objective of this study is to establish a predictive computational model for the volumetric growth of pulmonary arterial (PA) tissue following complex cardiovascular patch reconstructive surgeries for congenital heart disease patients. For the first time in the literature, the growth mechanics and performance of artificial cardiovascular patches in contact with the growing PA tissue domain is established. An elastic-growing material model was developed in the open source FEBio software suite to first examine the surgical patch reconstruction process for an idealized main PA anatomy as a benchmark model and then for the patient-specific PA of a newborn. Following patch reconstruction, high levels of stress and strain are compensated by growth on the arterial tissue. As this growth progresses, the arterial tissue is predicted to stiffen to limit elastic deformations. We simulated this arterial growth up to the age of 18 years, when somatic growth plateaus. Our research findings show that the non-growing patch material remains in a low strain state throughout the simulation timeline, while experiencing high stress hot-spots. Arterial tissue growth along the surgical stitch lines is triggered mainly due to PA geometry and blood pressure, rather than due to material property differences in the artificial and native tissue. Thus, non-uniform growth patterns are observed along the arterial tissue proximal to the sutured boundaries. This computational approach is effective for the pre-surgical planning of complex patch surgeries to quantify the unbalanced growth of native arteries and artificial non-growing materials to develop optimal patch biomechanics for improved postoperative outcomes. © 2021",FALSE,

Specifically, their expressions for incompressible plane stress problems are obtained. The use of a Lebedev quadrature, built exploiting the octahedral symmetry, is then proposed, illustrating the particular choice adopted for the orientation of the integration points. Next, the convergence of this quadrature scheme is assessed by means of three numerical benchmark tests, highlighting the advantages with respect to other angular integration methods available in the literature.

Due to the complexity of the craniomaxillofacial (CMF) anatomy, orthognathic surgery requires precise surgical planning, which involves predicting postoperative changes in facial appearance. To this end, most conventional methods involve simulation with biomechanical modeling methods, which are labor intensive and computationally expensive. Here we introduce a learning-based framework to speed up the simulation of postoperative facial appearances. Specifically, we introduce a facial shape change prediction network (FSC-Net) to learn the nonlinear mapping from bony shape changes to facial shape changes. FSC-Net is a point transform network weakly-supervised by paired preoperative and postoperative data without point-wise correspondence. In FSC-Net, a distance-guided shape loss places more emphasis on the jaw region. A local point constraint loss restricts point displacements to preserve the topology and smoothness of the surface mesh after point transformation. Evaluation results indicate that FSC-Net achieves 15× speedup with accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art (SOTA) finite-element modeling (FEM) method.",FALSE,

To replicate this type of trauma, which can be caused by a road accident, a three-point bending test is considered using experimental tests and numerical simulations. The withstand evaluation of the tibia-PL and tibia-IMN structures was conducted by following the load transfer through, the bone and the used implants. The analysis, up to tibia failure, required the use of an elasto-plastic behavior law coupled to damage. The model parameters were identified using experimental tests. Il was shown that the tibia-IMN structure provided a bending resistant load up to three-times higher than the tibia-PL. In fact, the used screws for plate fixation induced a high level of stress in the vicinity of threaded region, leading to a crack initiation and a damage propagation. However, in tibia-IMN structure the highest stress was generated in the trapped zone between the loader and the nail, promoting crack formation.

In this phantom study, the feasibility of a noninvasive hybrid registration method is assessed. This method consists of a point registration with anatomic landmarks for initialization and a surface registration using the bare mandibular bone surface for optimization. Methods: Three mandible phantoms with reference notches on two osteotomy planes were 3D printed. An electromagnetic tracking system in combination with 3D Slicer software was used for navigation. Different configurations, i.e., different surface point areas and number and configuration of surface points, were tested with a dentate phantom (A) in a metal-free environment. To simulate the intraoperative environment and different anatomies, the registration procedure was also performed with an OR bed using the dentate phantom and two (partially) edentulous phantoms with atypical anatomy (B and C). The accuracy of the registration was calculated using the notches on the osteotomy planes and was expressed as the target registration error (TRE). TRE values of less than 2.0 mm were considered as clinically acceptable. Results: In all experiments, the mean TRE was less than 2.0 mm. No differences were found using different surface point areas or number or configurations of surface points. Registration accuracy in the simulated intraoperative setting was—mean (SD)—0.96 (0.22), 0.93 (0.26), and 1.50 (0.28) mm for phantom A, phantom B, and phantom C.

Here, we report the morphological and lacunar properties of patient-paired bone samples from eight patients from the jaw (AB; recipient site) and the fibula (FB; donor site) on the micron length-scale using Synchrotron µ-CT. Insights into differences and similarities between these bone structures could offer a better understanding of the underlying mechanism for successful surgical outcomes and might clear the path for optimized, nature-inspired bone scaffold designs. Methods: Spatial vessel-pore arrangements, bone morphology, fluid-simulation derived permeability tensor, osteocyte lacunar density, and lacunar morphology are compared. Results: The orientation of the vessel system indicates a homogenous vessel orientation for AB and FB. The average mineral distance (50%) to the closest vessel boundary is higher in AB than in FB (the mean is 96 μm for AB vs. 76 μm for FB; p = 0.021). Average osteocyte lacunar density is found to be higher in AB than in FB (mean 22,874 mm3 vs. 19,376 mm3 for FB; p = 0.038), which might compensate for the high distance from the mineral to the nearest vessel. No significant differences in lacunar volume are found between paired AB and FB. Discussion: A comparable vessel network and similar distribution of vessel porosity between AB and FB may allow the FB graft to exhibit a high regeneration potential when connected to AB, and this might correlate with a high osteoinductive and osteoconductive potential of FB when connected to AB. Since widely used and potent synthetic bone grafts exist, new insight into the bone structure of well-established autologous bone grafts, such as the free fibula flap, could help to improve the performance of such materials and therefore the design of 3D scaffolds.

The proposed sensor is fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques and utilizes Neodymium magnets embedded in an elastomer over Hall sensors such that their displacement produces a voltage change that can be used to calculate the applied force. The initial spacing between the magnets and the Hall sensors is optimized to achieve a large displacement range using finite element method (FEM) simulations.

Genetic Algorithm-Based Optimization for the Geometric Design of a Novel Orthopedic Implant,You W.S.; Casebier J.; Mandich J.; Balasubramanian R.,2021,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2021.3080226,"Objective: A tendon-transfer is a reconstructive orthopedic surgery where tendons are re-routed from a non-functioning muscle and attached a functioning muscle. Prior work has shown that using a passive implanted device in the ECRL-to-FDP tendon-transfer surgery significantly improves hand grasping function. However, it is still unclear how hand-function improvement, measured by finger joint range of motion and torque, is dependent on the implant's geometry and location within the tendon network. This paper presents a genetic algorithm that determines the device's optimal geometry and location. Methods: Hand biomechanical simulation platform was developed to model hand function and also model the tendon-transfer surgery with and without the implant. Finger kinematics and joint torque were used to develop three unique objective functions to optimize the implant's parameters. Results: The optimized device resulted in an 11X increase in finger kinematics with only a 0.9% decrease in joint torque when compared with the biomechanical function enabled by the current suture-based surgery. Conclusion: Designing implantable devices that modify musculoskeletal function is challenging. Factors like tendon routing and joint kinematics create a complex nonlinear system when considering biomechanical function. A genetic algorithm is an effective tool to tackle these nonlinear landscapes to produce optimized designs. Significance: The state-of-the-art surgical procedure to repair high median-ulnar nerve palsy leads to poor hand function and severely limits the patient's ability to perform activities of daily life. This work provides a method for defining relevant objective functions for hand biomechanical function and then uses those objective functions with genetic algorithms to optimize the geometry of an orthopedic implant across multiple variables.

The purpose of this study was to test the biocompatibility of the SM with human limbus–derived epithelial cells with regard to their physical and biological properties. Methods: Different physical properties of SM were tested ex vivo by simulation on human corneas. In vitro, primary limbal epithelial cells from limbal explants were used to test biological properties such as cell migration, proliferation, metabolic activity, and limbal epithelial cell markers on the SM, hAM, and freeze-dried amniotic membrane (FDAM). Results: The surgical handleability of the SM was equivalent to that of the hAM. Ultrastructural and histological studies demonstrated that epithelial cells on the SM had the typical tightly apposed, polygonal, corneal epithelial cell morphology. The epithelial cells were well stratified on the SM, unlike on the hAM and FDAM. Rapid wound healing occurred on the SM within 3 days. Immunofluorescence studies showed positive expression of CK-19, Col-1, laminin, ZO-1, FN, and p-63 on the SM, plastic, and FDAM compared to positive expression of ZO-1, Col-1, laminin, FN, and p63 and negative expression of CK-19 in the hAM. Conclusions: These results indicate that the SM is a better substrate for limbal epithelial cell migration, proliferation, and tight junction formation. Altogether, the SM can provide a suitable alternative to the hAM for surgical application in sight-restoring operations.

Four spiral-type prototypes are constructed, and three scenarios for each prototype, varying in projection distance from the device handle to the bone-device contact point, are examined via nonlinear simulation analyses. For the L-shaped type, three prototypes are developed, and static analyses are conducted for four scenarios per prototype, differing in traction force locations, based on another simulation result concerning moments of inertia calculation with a force boundary condition unlike pressure. Maximum stress results under a specific force are analyzed, and the maximum permissible force is determined under the most unfavorable force application condition. Simulation outcomes indicate that the spiral type offers greater applicability with less force to lift multiple bones, while the L-shaped type is more suitable under bone hardening conditions. © 2025 The Author(s).

Augmented reality simulation framework for minimally invasive orthopedic surgery,Cangelosi A.; Riberi G.; Titolo P.; Salvi M.; Molinari F.; Ulrich L.; Vezzetti E.; Agus M.; Calì C.,2025,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.109943,"Purpose: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has emerged in clinical practice to minimize surgical trauma, providing patients with faster recovery, reduced pain and complications and enhanced aesthetic results compared to traditional surgery. However, this approach increase the risk of iatrogenic damage, i.e. the accidental injury to sensitive anatomical structures (eg. nerves and vascular strcuteres) not directly visible during a percutaneous access. Augmented reality (AR) can effectively mitigate these drawbacks by overlaying graphical information onto the surgical field and providing real-time feedback, offering support in training settings and clinical practice. Implementation challenges have limited the number of case studies in the scientific literature. This study presents a novel simulation paradigm for orthopedic surgery training, filling a gap in surgical skill development resources for trainees, and demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach. Methods: The proposed methodology provides a framework for building a cost-effective and easily reproducible surgical training simulation environment. To address the challenge of mental spatial navigation during MIS procedures, the framework's rationale is to address the challenge of mental spatial navigation during MIS procedures. A surgical gesture tracking system using a commercial depth camera for comfortable simulation was developed. The principles of the acquisition system, image processing, and spatial computation mechanics are detailed to illustrate the framework's applicability. Digital environments customization with game engines to simulate expensive medical instrumentation, such as the C-arm, is also demonstrated. The simulation platform comprises a Computer Vision (CV) module, an X-ray machine simulation module, and an AR module. Results: System validation involved analysis at different framework levels. From texture analysis of acquired images to application accuracy evaluation, the influence of various parameters on system performance is demonstrated. The simulation system is a valuable tool for learning minimally invasive procedures and for developers building AR systems for medical applications. The implementation is focused on the insertion surgical devices, including screws and K-wires. This is results in real application in minimizing the risk of iatrogenic injury to neural and vascular structures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of highly reproducible accuracy between real and virtual environment an analysis of errors and accuracies is illustrated at level of different subsystems. Measurement between comparative measurement between vernier caliper and simulation system methods shows a R>0.9 with a p<0.01. Application accuracy was evaluated using the following parameters. The relative point-to-point accuracy averaged 1.02mm with a standard deviation of 2.82mm.

On interaction between fatigue of reconstruction plate and time-dependent bone remodeling,Wan B.; Yoda N.; Zheng K.; Zhang Z.; Wu C.; Clark J.; Sasaki K.; Swain M.; Li Q.,2022,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105483,"Background and objective: The fibula free flap (FFF) has been extensively used to repair large segmental bone defects in the maxillofacial region. The reconstruction plate plays a key role in maintaining stability and load-sharing while the fibula unites with adjacent bone in the course of healing and remodeling. However, not all fibula flaps would fully unite, and fatigue of prosthetic devices has been recognized as one major concern for long-term load-bearing applications. This study aims to develop a numerical approach for predicting the fatigue life of the reconstruction plate by taking into account the effect of ongoing bone remodeling. Methods: The patient-specific mandible reconstruction with a prosthetic system is studied in this work. The 3D finite element model with heterogeneous material properties obtained from clinical computerized tomography (CT) data is developed for bone, and eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is adopted for the fatigue analysis of the plate. During the remodeling process, the changing apparent density and Young's modulus of bone are simulated in a step-wise fashion on the basis of Wolff's law, which is correlated with the specific clinical follow-up. The maximum biting forces were considered as the driving force on the bone remodeling, which are measured clinically at different time points (4, 16 and 28 months) after reconstruction surgery. Results: Under various occlusal loadings, the interaction between fatigue crack growth and bone remodeling is investigated to gain new insights for the future design of prosthetic devices. The simulation results reveal that appropriate remodeling of grafted bone could extend the fatigue life of fixation plates in a positive way. On the other hand, the rising occlusal load associated with healing and remodeling could lead to fatigue fracture of fixation plate and potentially cause severe bone resorption. Conclusion: This study proposes an effective approach for more realistically predicting fatigue life of prosthetic devices subject to a tissue remodeling condition in-silico. It is anticipated to provide a guideline for deriving an optimal design of patient-specific prosthetic devices to better ensure longevity. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,
An in-silico bone drilling protocol to control thrust forces using finite element analysis coupled with the constitutive models,Prasannavenkadesan V.; Pandithevan P.,2022,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science",10.1177/09544062221088403,"In orthopaedic surgeries, drilling through bone is most widely used to fix the plates and implants. The uncontrolled large thrust forces generated during bone drilling cause micro-crack, and fragmentation around the local host bone which further loosen the implant and fixation. Owing to the experimental limitation and the risk of infection in handling the bone specimens, conducting experiments with all possible combinations of parameter values and selecting the suitable combination is largely limited. So in this paper, finite element analysis coupled with the constitutive models was used to early predict the thrust forces generated in the surgical bone drilling process. The constitutive models developed in the earlier study, namely, Johnson–Cook, Cowper–Symonds, and Johnson–Cook combined with Cowper–Symonds that consider the strain rate dependence of plastic curve were used for the simulations. Results revealed that the trends of the thrust force values predicted from the constitutive models matched well with the experiments. However, the study showed that the Johnson–Cook model combined with the Cowper–Symonds model predicted the thrust forces with a maximum error of only 9.51% followed by the Johnson–Cook model and Cowper–Symonds model with 15.83% and 21.89%, respectively. The outcomes of the study can be used to predict the thrust forces generated in the bone drilling process, and thus, suitable parameters values can be selected to avoid the mechanical damages around the bone drilling site. The outcomes can also be used to plan and rehearse the in-silico bone drilling trials with any combinations of parameter values before performing the actual surgery. © IMechE 2022.",FALSE,
Exploring uncertainty in hyper-viscoelastic properties of scalp skin through patient-specific finite element models for reconstructive surgery,Song G.; Gosain A.K.; Buganza Tepole A.; Rhee K.; Lee T.,2025,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1080/10255842.2024.2313067,"Understanding skin responses to external forces is crucial for post-cutaneous flap wound healing. However, the in vivo viscoelastic behavior of scalp skin remains poorly understood. Personalized virtual surgery simulations offer a way to study tissue responses in relevant 3D geometries. Yet, anticipating wound risk remains challenging due to limited data on skin viscoelasticity, which hinders our ability to determine the interplay between wound size and stress levels. To bridge this gap, we reexamine three clinical cases involving scalp reconstruction using patient-specific geometric models and employ uncertainty quantification through a Monte Carlo simulation approach to study the effect of skin viscoelasticity on the final stress levels from reconstructive surgery. Utilizing the generalized Maxwell model via the Prony series, we can parameterize and efficiently sample a realistic range of viscoelastic response and thus shed light on the influence of viscoelastic material uncertainty in surgical scenarios. Our analysis identifies regions at risk of wound complications based on reported threshold stress values from the literature and highlights the significance of focusing on long-term responses rather than short-term ones. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",FALSE,
The effect of bone plasticity models on simulations of primary fixation in total knee arthroplasty,Soltanihafshejani N.; Bitter T.; Verdonschot N.; Janssen D.,2025,Medical Engineering and Physics,10.1016/j.medengphy.2025.104329,"Predictions of primary fixation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can aid in implant design, optimizing long-term survival. Finite element (FE) simulations are commonly used to assess micromotions at the bone-implant interface during daily activities, requiring accurate computational models. A key factor is the material model used to simulate bone properties. This study evaluated two plastic material models—Isotropic Crushable Foam (ICF) and softening Von-Mises (sVM)—for predicting primary fixation in femoral TKA components. Mechanical tests on human femoral trabecular bone samples under cyclic loading were replicated using FE simulations with ICF and sVM models. These models were then applied to FE simulations of three femoral TKA reconstructions, representing patients aged 57, 73, and 90 years. The ICF model replicated the gradual plastic deformation observed in experiments, unlike the sVM model, and more closely matched the permanent deformation of bone samples. In primary fixation simulations, micromotions at the bone-implant interface averaged 27 µm with ICF and 17 µm with sVM. While both predictions fall within acceptable ranges, the ICF model, as a pressure-dependent material model, more accurately replicates experimental energy dissipation and plastic deformation patterns, closely mirroring human bone's plastic behavior. This makes it better suited for simulating implant-bone interface micromotions in primary TKA fixation. © 2025 The Author(s)",FALSE,

Therapeutic Validation of Venous Pulsatile Tinnitus and Biomaterial Applications for Temporal Bone Reconstruction Surgery Using Multi-sensing Platforms and Coupled Computational Techniques,Hsieh Y.-L.; Gao X.; Wang X.; Hsiang F.-C.; Sun X.; Wang W.,2022,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2021.777648,"The application of grafts and biomaterials is a cardinal therapeutic procedure to resolve venous pulsatile tinnitus (PT) caused by temporal bone dehiscence during transtemporal reconstructive surgery. However, the transmission mechanism of venous PT remains unclear, and the sound absorption and insulation properties of different repair materials have not been specified. This study quantifies the vibroacoustic characteristics of PT, sources the major transmission pathway of PT, and verifies the therapeutic effect of different material applications using joint multi-sensing platforms and coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. The in vivo intraoperative acoustic and vibroacoustic characteristics of intrasinus blood flow motion and dehiscent sigmoid plate of a typical venous PT patient were investigated using acoustic and displacement sensors. The acoustical, morphological, and mechanical properties of the dehiscent sigmoid plate, grafts harvested from a cadaveric head, and other biomaterials were acquired using acoustical impedance tubes, micro-CT, scanning electron microscopy, and mercury porosimetry, as appropriate. To analyze the therapeutic effect of our previous reconstructive techniques, coupled CFD simulations were performed using the acquired mechanical properties of biomaterials and patient-specific radiologic data. The peak in vivo intraoperatively gauged, peak simulated vibroacoustic and peak simulated hydroacoustic amplitude of PT prior to sigmoid plate reconstruction were 64.0, 70.4, and 72.8 dB, respectively. After the solidified gelatin sponge–bone wax repair technique, the intraoperative gauged peak amplitude of PT was reduced from 64.0 to 47.3 dB. Among three different reconstructive techniques based on CFD results, the vibroacoustic and hydroacoustic sounds were reduced to 65.9 and 68.6 dB (temporalis–cartilage technique), 63.5 and 63.1 dB (solidified gelatin sponge technique), and 42.4 and 39.2 dB (solidified gelatin sponge–bone wax technique). In conclusion, the current novel biosensing applications and coupled CFD techniques indicate that the sensation of PT correlates with the motion and impact from venous flow, causing vibroacoustic and hydroacoustic sources that transmit via the air-conduction transmission pathway. The transtemporal reconstructive surgical efficacy depends on the established areal density of applied grafts and/or biomaterials, in which the total transmission loss of PT should surpass the amplitude of the measured loudness of PT.

Design and Simulation of a 2-Degree of Freedom Energy Harvester from Blood Flow for Powering the Pacemaker,Abdelmawgoud M.; Parque V.; Nada A.; Fath El-Bab A.M.R.,2025,Journal of Robotics and Control (JRC),10.18196/jrc.v6i1.23953,"The pacemaker is a device that is used to treat different abnormal heart rhythms. It is usually powered using traditional batteries. These batteries run out of power after about 7 years, necessitating the replacement of either the pacemaker or its batteries for the patient’s survival. This means that the patient will need to undergo surgery for the replacement process which can compromise the patient’s life and increase the probability of being infected, not to mention the operation cost. To overcome this problem, energy harvesters can be a safer substitute for these traditional batteries since they can convert different forms of energy into electric energy, which can be stored and used when needed. In this paper, a 2-degree-of-freedom (DOF) piezoelectric energy harvester from blood flow is designed and modeled. The harvester is designed as a cut-out beam that is fixed on the pacemaker lead that passes through the Superior Vena Cava (SVC). To protect the harvester from being highly distorted by the blood flow, a plastic barrier is added in front of the harvester from the vein’s inlet side. The harvester consists of three layers, a PZT-5A layer sandwiched between two plastic layers. The harvester is designed to have its first and second natural frequencies between 1Hz and 1.67Hz, the normal frequency range of the human heartbeat. The harvester harvests up to 3.8V which is considered satisfying since the pacemaker usually stimulates the heart using a voltage that ranges from 1V to 10V . This voltage can be used to power the pacemaker and extend its lifetime. The harvester was simulated using ANSYS Workbench Software 2020 R2. On the simulation level, the harvester obtained a maximum output power of 0.81µW at a load of 2.2MΩ. © 2025 Department of Agribusiness, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.

The current approach of surgical education mainly involves didactic teaching and psychomotor training through physical models or real tissue. Due to the unavailability of physical resources and lack of objective ways of evaluation, there is a demand for developing alternative training methods for surgeons. In this paper, we present an application that provides additional training opportunities to surgical trainees in the field of facial reconstructive surgeries. Methods: We built a mobile augmented reality application that helps the user to visualize important concepts and experiment with different surgical plans for facial reconstructive surgeries. The application can overlay relaxed skin tension lines on a live video input or a patient's photo, which serve as bases for aligning a skin flap. A surgical trainee can interactively compare different skin flap design choices with estimated final scars on a photo of a patient. Data collection capability is also added to the application, and we performed a Monte Carlo experiment with simulated users (five classes of 100 users each) as an example of objectively measuring user performance. Results: The application can overlay relaxed skin tension lines on a patient's face in real time on a modern mobile device. Accurate overlays were achieved in over 91% as well as 84% and 88% out of 263 generated face images, depending on the method. Visual comparisons of the three overlay methods are presented on sample faces from different population groups.

It can objectively evaluate the performance of surgical trainees in a course.

Assessment of Maxillary Expansion Techniques by means of 3D Elastoplastic Finite Element Static Simulation,Shosheva O.; Zhmaylo M.; Maslov L.; Borovkov A.; Vishneva N.; Lanina A.; Yaremenko A.,2025,Journal of Applied and Computational Mechanics,10.22055/jacm.2024.47055.4653,"Even though numerous studies considered various approaches for maxillary expansion, there is still no consensus on which method is optimal for a patient with a particular clinical picture. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal technique from the procedures proposed by doctors for a patient with completed facial skeleton growth. In this paper we consider four scenarios of surgical intervention, i.e., without osteotomy, midpalatal suture osteotomy, experimental osteotomy of zygomatico-alveolar ridge on the both sides of maxilla, and midpalatal suture osteotomy with osteotomy of zygomatico-alveolar ridge. In addition, two experimental appliances (one-screw expander and two-screw expander) and two positioning configurations of them (parallel to the hard palate and horizontal) are under consideration at the suggestion of the doctors. The criteria for determining the optimal technique are established in the article. Three-dimensional finite element (FE) models of skull and teeth of an adult 43-year-old patient with an ossified midpalatal suture are constructed based on the results of computed tomography, while the 3D models for the expander components are built separately and combined into the full FE system. The corresponding elastoplastic properties are adopted for the bone tissues and expander components. After proper skull fixation at the bottom, a quasi-static displacement of 0.25 mm, corresponding to quarter-turn of the control screw, is applied to the expander components to stimulate the maxillary expansion. All analyses in the paper are performed in the SIMULIA Abaqus 2021 software suite. Displacements and stresses in the bone structures of the hard palate and the appliance are obtained for all the cases studied. It was revealed that the expansion of the midpalatal suture is small in the cases without surgical intervention. A significantly greater expansion of the midpalatal suture is observed as a result of midpalatal suture osteotomy. Osteotomy of the zygomatico-alveolar ridge has virtually no effect on the value of the midpalatal suture expansion. Midpalatal suture osteotomy combined with osteotomy of the zygomatico-alveolar ridge leads to maximum expansion of the midpalatal suture. However, additional osteotomy of the zygomatico-alveolar ridge induces a proportionally greater increase in the expansion value at the dental level (by 24.8–25.8%) than at the midpalatal suture level (by 10.8–16.2%). Unlike the one-screw expander, using the two-screw expander leads to a 21.4– 22.9% greater expansion of the midpalatal suture in the cases with midpalatal suture osteotomy, but increases the highly stressed regions and the magnitude of plastic strains in them. The horizontal position of the expander contributes to a more symmetrical expansion of the maxilla than positioning the expander parallel to the palate. Based on the analysis performed, we believe that midpalatal suture osteotomy might be the best scenario for surgical intervention for maxillary expansion in patients with completed facial skeleton growth. The two-screw expander is more effective in terms of maxillary expansion values, but it increases the risk of bone resorption. It is also found that providing osteotomy of zygomatico-alveolar ridge and changing the position of the expander practically does not affect the expansion state. Thus, our findings can serve as a basis for doctors deciding which scenario of surgical intervention and expander configuration would be more appropriate for a particular patient. © 2024 Published by Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical simulation, not on predicting or evaluating aesthetics in surgery."

The femoral condyle and extension rod components were simulated with cobalt chromium molybdenum (CoCrMo), PEEK and CF30-PEEK materials respectively. When simulating the standing state, a vertical stress of 700 N is applied to the femoral head. When simulating the squatting state, a vertical stress of 2800 N is applied to the femoral head.

Methods: This paper presents an interactive, cognitive, facial flaps simulator based on a projective dynamics computational framework. Projective dynamics is able to generate rapid, stable results following changes to the facial soft tissues created by the surgeon, even in the face of sudden increases in skin resistance as its stretch limit is reached or collision between tissues occurs.

The mean blood loss was significantly lower in the simulation group, p = 0.01. No statistical significant differences were found regarding radiological results (p = 0.16). No per-operative complications were recorded. Conclusion: This study confirms that pre-operative planning in acetabular surgery based on a PSBM results in a shorter operative time and a reduction of blood loss during surgery.

A memory effect model to predict COVID-19: analysis and simulation,Ali A.; Hamou A.A.; Islam S.; Muhammad T.; Khan A.,2023,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1080/10255842.2022.2081503,"A memory effect model to predict COVID-19: analysis and simulation  On 19 September 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that asymptomatic individuals, those who have close contact with infected person, be tested. Also, American society for biological clinical comments on testing of asymptomatic individuals. So, we proposed a new mathematical model for evaluating the population-level impact of contact rates (social-distancing) and the rate at which asymptomatic people are hospitalized (isolated) following testing due to close contact with documented infected people. The model is a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations that is fitted and parameterized by least square curve fitting using COVID-19 pandemic data of Pakistan from 1 October 2020 to 30 April 2021. The fractional derivative is used to understand the biological process with crossover behavior and memory effect. The reproduction number and conditions for asymptotic stability are derived diligently. The most common non-integer Caputo derivative is used for deeper analysis and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 infection. The fractional-order Adams–Bashforth method is used for the solution of the model.

The computational model used in this analysis was created from an unknown patient dataset available in the Embodi3d online library. The segmentation, three-dimensional reconstruction, and modeling of the structures involved were performed using Materialise Mimics and Rhino3D. The FDP tendon excursion and stress values present in the model were calculated in the ANSYS environment. Based on the finite-element simulation, the FDP tendon presents an excursion of 10.1 mm during passive postoperative flexion. The highest-stress values were observed between the pulleys-FDP tendon contact surfaces. In particular, the pulley A1 exhibited the maximum principal stress of the model with a 58.7 MPa. The pulley A3 showed the same stress distribution pattern that A1 Pulley, but with the lowest values. The FDP Tendon excursion obtained is consistent with the results reported in the literature, which vary from 8 to 11 mm. The stress values found in the model explain the importance of the pulley mechanism keeping the FDP tendon attached to the finger bone during the range of motion experienced.

How to predict structural allograft survival in tibial reconstructions,Evrard R.; Manon J.; Docquier P.-L.; Cornu O.; Schubert T.,2025,Cell and Tissue Banking,10.1007/s10561-025-10172-5,"Tibial reconstruction for major bone loss is a challenging surgical situation. For more than 30 years, massive bone allografts entered our therapeutic arsenal as a major tool to reconstruct large bone defect. Despite allograft is valued for its convenience, it is still burdened by a high complication rate. This retrospective monocentric study focuses on the clinical outcomes of massive tibial allografts and their outcome’s prediction. Between 1987 and 2022, the files of 148 massive tibial allografts were retrospectively reviewed (registration number B403201523492). Survival curves were calculated based on the allograft success or failure. Survival curves without revision surgery were calculated following the same design. Finally, multiple logistic regression models were set up to point out variables that influence the allograft survival. After 30 years, 87.2% of the patient retained limb function. However, 55% of the allograft failed and had to be removed (mean survival time is 20.06 ± 2.07 years (CI 16.0–24.1)). The estimate mean survival time is 10.26 ± 1.60 years (CI 7.1–13.4) with less than 20% survival for the allografts without revision surgery after 30 years. Tumor and septic indications worsen the prognosis as well as the number of revision surgeries and the osteochondral allograft type. In contrast, PSI use or traumatological indications improve the allograft survival. Despite remaining an excellent surgical reconstructive option, massive tibial allografts show a high revision surgery rate.

Preoperative photographs were processed using mirror image software to create images simulating the expected postoperative appearance by mirroring the contralateral eyelid. The simulated images were compared with actual postoperative photographs taken 3 months after surgery. The degree of agreement between simulated and actual postoperative images was assessed using subjective evaluation by patients and surgeons and objective measurements of eyelid parameters. Results The simulated images closely resembled the actual postoperative appearance in most cases. Both patients and surgeons reported high satisfaction with the accuracy of the simulated images.

3d-printed sacral reconstruction prosthesis from multiscale topology optimization: A comprehensive numerical assessment of mechanical stability,Jitkla N.; Pinyonitikasem A.; Wiwatsuwan P.; Pairojboriboon S.; Promoppatum P.,2025,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.109562,"Sacral chordoma, an invasive tumor, necessitates surgical removal of the tumor and the affected region of the sacrum, disrupting the spinopelvic connection. Conventional reconstruction methods, relying on rod and screw systems, often face challenges such as rod failure, sub-optimal stability, and limited osseointegration. This study proposes a novel design for a porous-based sacral reconstruction prosthesis. The design framework involves a two-step topology optimization (TO) process. The first TO step is utilized to obtain the external shape of a patient-specific prosthesis, while the second TO step determines varied density fields. These fields are later integrated with graded Gyroid structures to generate the porous-based sacral prosthesis. Finite element simulations reveal several benefits of the newly developed device. Firstly, considering only solid-based TO tends to result in a highly rigid spinal movement, which may not be entirely favorable. However, the porous-based technique allows for a wider design space, enabling the sacral device's stiffness to be more comprehensively engineered. Secondly, with porous integration, the prosthesis shows potential for promoting bone integration over time, thereby providing further biological fixation and improving long-term structural stability. Thirdly, the porous-based prosthesis outperforms conventional methods such as four-rod reconstruction (FRR) and four-rod plus anterior column reconstruction (FRACR) by reducing maximum von Mises stress in the instruments by approximately 50–80 %. In summary, this study demonstrates how a two-step TO framework can create a superior sacral prosthesis, enhancing its mechanical performance and impact on spinopelvic stability.

Biomechanical evaluation on a novel design of biodegradable embossed locking compression plate for orthopaedic applications using finite element analysis,Chandra G.; Pandey A.,2022,Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology,10.1007/s10237-022-01596-z,"In orthopaedics, conventional implant plates such as locking compression plate (LCP) made from non-biodegradable materials play a vital role in the fixation to support bone fractures, but also create a complication such as stress shielding. These again require a painful surgery to remove/replace after they have healed as it does not degrade into the physiological environment (PE). Currently, there has already been enough discovery of biodegradable materials that, despite being mechanically inefficient compared to non-biodegradable materials, can completely be biodegraded in PE during and after healing to avoid such problems. While there has been insufficient research on the design of biodegradable implant plates, the implementation of which may help achieve the goal with an effort of high mechanical strength. A novel design of biodegradable embossed locking compression plate (BELCP) is designed for biodegradable materials to approach superior mechanical performance and complete degradation over time, considering all such parameters and factors. For biomechanical evaluation, four-point bending test (4PBT), axial compressive and tensile test (ACTT) and torsion test (TT) have been performed on LCP, BELCP and its continuously degraded forms made of biodegradable material (Mg-alloy) using finite element method. BELCP has found 50%, 100% and 100% higher mechanical performance and safer in 4PBT, ACTT and TT, respectively, than LCP. Moreover, BELCP has also observed safe during continuous degradation up to 6 months after implantation under these three tests, considering an approximate sustained degradation rate of about 4 mm/year. Even Mg-alloy made BELCP can be sufficient and safer to support fractured bone than SS-alloy made LCP, but not Ti-alloy made LCP.

Current reconstruction algorithms mainly generate reference models from the image analysis aspect, however, clinical indicators of the CMF reference model mostly consider the distribution of anatomical landmarks. Generating a reference model with optimal clinical evaluation helps promote the feasibility of an algorithm. Methods: We first build a dataset with 100 normal skull models and then calculate a statistical shape model (SSM) and the distribution of normal cephalometric values, which indicate the statistical features of a population. To further generate personalized reference models, we apply non-rigid registration to align the SSM with the defect skull model. An evaluation standard to select the optimal reference model considers both global performance and anatomical evaluation. Moreover, we develop a landmark detection network to improve the automatic level of the algorithm. Results: The proposed method performs better than methods including Iterative Closest Point and SSM. From a global evaluation aspect, the results show that the RMSE between the reference model and the ground truth is 1.71 ± 0.23 mm, the percentage of vertices with error below 2 mm is 85 ± 4 % and the average faces distance is 1.38 ± 0.20 mm (better than the state-of-the-art method). From the anatomical evaluation aspect, the target registration error between the landmark pairs is 4.12 ± 2.27 mm. In addition, the clinical application confirms that the reference model can meet clinical requirements. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first CMF reconstruction method considering the global performance of reconstruction and anatomically local evaluation from clinical experience.

Multi-modal feature-fusion for CT metal artifact reduction using edge-enhanced generative adversarial networks,Huang Z.; Zhang G.; Lin J.; Pang Y.; Wang H.; Bai T.; Zhong L.,2022,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.106700,"Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is one of the most widely-used and cost-effective technology for organ screening and diseases diagnosis. Because of existence of metallic implants in some patients, the CT images acquired from these patients are often corrupted by undesirable metal artifacts, which causes severe problem of metal artifact. Although there have been proposed many methods to reduce metal artifact, reduction is still challenging and inadequate, and results are suffering from symptom variance, second artifact and poor subjective evaluation. To address these problems, we propose a novel metal artifact reduction method based on generative adversarial networks to simultaneously reduce metal artifacts and enhance texture structure of corrected CT images. Specifically, we firstly incorporate interactive information (text) and imaging CT (image) into a comprehensive feature to yield multi-modal feature-fusion representation, which overcomes the representative ability limitation of single-modal data. The incorporation of interaction information constrains the feature generation to ensure symptom consistency between corrected and target CT. Then, we design an edge-enhance sub-network to avoid second artifact and suppress noise. Besides, we invite three professional physicians to evaluate corrected CT image subjectively. In this paper, We achieved average increment of 11.3% PSNR and 12.1% SSIM on DeepLesion dataset. The subjective evaluations by physicians show that ours outperforms over 6.3%, 7.1%, 5.50% and 6.9% in term of sharpness, resolution, invariance and acceptability, respectively.

The secondary goal of this study is to compare the long-term outcomes of different designs of fixation plate with specific screw positioning. The results indicated that the overall bone density decreased over time, except for the Docking Site (namely DS1, a region of interest in mandibular symphysis with the conjunction of the bone union), in which the decrease of bone density ceased later and was followed by bone apposition.

Radiographic film paper is traditionally employed to bidimensionally trace the structures of the contralateral healthy ear in a quasi-artistic manner. Anatomical points provide linear and angular measurements. However, this technique proves time-consuming, subjectivity-rich, and greatly dependent on surgeon expertise. Hence, it’s susceptible to shape errors and misplacement. Methods: We present an innovative clinical workflow that combines 3D printing and augmented reality (AR) to increase objectivity and reproducibility of these procedures. Specifically, we introduce patient-specific 3D cutting templates and remodeling molds to carve and construct the cartilaginous framework that will conform the new ear. Moreover, we developed an in-house AR application compatible with any commercial Android tablet. It precisely guides the positioning of the new ear during surgery, ensuring symmetrical alignment with the healthy one and avoiding time-consuming intraoperative linear or angular measurements. Our solution was evaluated in one case, first with controlled experiments in a simulation scenario and finally during surgery. Results: Overall, the ears placed in the simulation scenario had a mean absolute deviation of 2.2 ± 1.7 mm with respect to the reference plan. During the surgical intervention, the reconstructed ear was 3.1 mm longer and 1.3 mm wider with respect to the ideal plan and had a positioning error of 2.7 ± 2.4 mm relative to the contralateral side. Note that in this case, additional morphometric variations were induced from inflammation and other issues intended to be addressed in a subsequent stage of surgery, which are independent of our proposed solution.

However, existing methods are unable to characterize inelastic behaviors of brain tissue, such as plastic deformation and dissection evolution, making it ineffective in simulating brain tumor removal procedures. Methods: In this paper, a model of fibrous soft tissue dissection for the simulation of brain tumor removal is proposed. A dissection variable of representative volume element is used to characterize the dissection state of the fibrous soft tissue. The evolution of dissection with elastic-plastic deformation under the effects of external loads is presented. Results: Simulation results show that the proposed model provides realistic, stable and intuitive results in the simulation of fracture in fibrous soft tissues. As the external load increases, the fibrous soft tissue begins to crack, with the cracks growing and multiplying until they eventually merge to form a fracture. The proposed model is incorporated into the simulation of brain tumor removal.

We propose a system to simulate and guide the shaping effect analysis, which could produce a similar but more harmonious face simulation. To this end, first, the depth camera based on structured light coding is employed for facial 3D data acquisition, from which the point cloud data of multiple facial perspectives could be obtained. Next, the cascade regression tree algorithm is used to extract the esthetic key points of the face model and to calculate the facial features composed of the key points, such as the nose, chin, and eyes. Quantitative facial esthetic indexes are offered to doctors to simulate PS. Afterward, we exploit a face mesh metamorphosis based on finite elements. We design several morphing operators, including augmentation, cutting, and lacerating. Finally, the regional deformation is detected, and the operation effect is quantitatively evaluated by registering the 3D scanning model before and after the operation. The test of our proposed system and the simulation of PS operations find that the measurement error of facial geometric features is 0.458 mm, and the area is 0.65 mm2. The ratings of the simulation outcomes provided by panels of PS prove that the system is effective.

However, human skin growth dynamics have not been evaluated in vivo. Previously, we quantified this process in a porcine model and developed a calibrated computational framework. Here, we create patient-specific finite element (FE) models of skin growth in TE using longitudinal 3D photos collected during TE treatment. These geometries enable Bayesian model calibration, accounting for uncertainties in boundary conditions, mechanical properties, and biological parameters. The framework incorporates prior knowledge from the porcine model as well as literature information on human skin mechanics. The likelihood function assesses alignment between predicted and observed geometries, and predicted and observed skin growth. To efficiently sample the posterior distribution, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with Gaussian process surrogates, reducing computational cost. This pipeline is demonstrated in five TE cases. Post-calibration, FE models closely match 3D photos, with errors below 2 mm on average. Notably, Bayesian calibration collapses the critical stretch parameter posterior distribution.

The Association Between Geometry and Wall Stress in Emergently Repaired Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,Chauhan S.S.; Gutierrez C.A.; Thirugnanasambandam M.; De Oliveira V.; Muluk S.C.; Eskandari M.K.; Finol E.A.,2017,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10439-017-1837-1,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a prevalent cardiovascular disease characterized by the focal dilation of the aorta, which supplies blood to all the organs and tissues in the systemic circulation. With the AAA increasing in diameter over time, the risk of aneurysm rupture is generally associated with the size of the aneurysm. If diagnosed on time, intervention is recommended to prevent AAA rupture. The criterion to decide on surgical intervention is determined by measuring the maximum diameter of the aneurysm relative to the critical value of 5.5 cm. However, a more reliable approach could be based on understanding the biomechanical behavior of the aneurysmal wall. In addition, geometric features that are proven to be significant predictors of the AAA wall mechanics could be used as surrogates of the AAA biomechanical behavior and, subsequently, of the aneurysm’s risk of rupture. The aim of this work is to identify those geometric indices that have a high correlation with AAA wall stress in the population of patients who received an emergent repair of their aneurysm. In-house segmentation and meshing algorithms were used to model 75 AAAs followed by estimation of the spatially distributed wall stress by performing finite element analysis. Fifty-two shape and size geometric indices were calculated for the same models using MATLAB scripting. Hypotheses testing were carried out to identify the indices significantly correlated with wall stress by constructing a Pearson’s correlation coefficient matrix. The analyses revealed that 12 indices displayed high correlation with the wall stress, amongst which wall thickness and curvature-based indices exhibited the highest correlations. Stepwise regression analysis of these correlated indices indicated that wall stress can be predicted by the following four indices with an accuracy of 76%: maximum aneurysm diameter, aneurysm sac length, average wall thickness at the maximum diameter cross-section, and the median of the wall thickness variance. The primary outcome of this work emphasizes the use of global measures of size and wall thickness as geometric surrogates of wall stress for emergently repaired AAAs. © 2017, Biomedical Engineering Society.",FALSE,

Laxity results from a progressive accumulation of plastic strain during the cyclic loading.

Therefore, in this work, the ability of numerical tools to predict the mechanical behaviour of the device during its degradation is discussed. Computational approaches based on elastoplastic and viscoplastic constitutive models are also presented. These models enable to simulate the plastic strain accumulation. These computational approaches, where the material model parameters depend on the hydrolytic degradation damage, are calibrated using experimental data measured from biodegradable suture fibres at different degradation steps. Due to durability requirements the selected materials are polydioxone (PDO) and polylactic acid and poly-caprolactone blend (PLA-PCL). Computational approaches investigated are able to predict well the experimental results for both materials, in full strain range until rupture and for different degradation steps. These approaches can be further used in more complex fibrous structures, to predict its global mechanical behaviour during degradation process. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",FALSE,
Automatic early-onset free flap failure detection for implantable biomedical devices,Rothfuss M.A.; Franconi N.G.; Star A.; Akcakaya M.; Gimbel M.L.; Sejdic E.,2018,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2018.2793763,"Objective: Up to 10% of free flap cases are compromised, and without prompt intervention, amputation and even death can occur. Hourly monitoring improves salvage rates, but the gold standard for monitoring requires experienced personnel to operate and suffers from high false-positive rates as high as 31% that result in costly and unnecessary surgeries. In this paper, we investigate free flap patency monitoring using automatic hardware-only classification systems that eliminate the need for experienced personnel. The expected flow ranges of the antegrade and retrograde veins for breast reconstruction are studied using a syringe pump to create the laminar flow seen in veins. Methods: Feature data extracted from the Doppler blood flow signals are analyzed for sensitivity, specificity, and false-positive rates. Hardware is built to perform the classification automatically in real-time and output a decision at the end of the observation period. Results: Experimental results using the hardware-only classifier for a 50 ms window size show high sensitivity (96.75%), specificity (90.20%), and low false-positive rate (9.803%). The experimental and theoretical classification results show close agreement. Conclusion: This work indicates that automatic hardware-only classifiers can eliminate the need for experienced personnel to monitor free flap patency. Significance: The hardware-only classification is amenable to a monolithic implementation and future studies should study a totally implantable wirelessly-powered blood flow classifier. The high classifier performance in a short window period indicates that duty-cycled powering can be used to extend the safe operational depth of an implant. This is particularly relevant for the difficult buried free flap applications. © 1964-2012 IEEE.",FALSE,
Cosmetic evaluation of breast conserving treatment for mammary cancer. 1. Proposal of a quantitative scoring system,"Van Limbergen, Erik and Van der Schueren, E and Van Tongelen, K",1989,Radiotherapy and oncology,Elsevier,"A quantitative scoring system for the cosmetic evaluation of breast conserving treatment for mammary cancer is proposed. The system is based on the assessment of four parameters: breast size, shape, nipple position and scar appearance. Each parameter is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better cosmetic results.

An artificial intelligence-based cosmesis evaluation for temporomandibular joint reconstruction,"Hidaka, Takeaki and Tanaka, Kentaro and Mori, Hiroki",2023,The Laryngoscope,Wiley Online Library,"Background: Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) reconstruction is a complex surgical procedure that can significantly impact facial cosmesis. Traditional methods for evaluating postoperative cosmesis are subjective and lack standardization. This study aims to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system for objective cosmesis evaluation following TMJ reconstruction.  Methods: A dataset of postoperative facial images from patients who underwent TMJ reconstruction was collected. An AI model utilizing deep learning techniques was trained to assess facial symmetry and aesthetic outcomes. The model's performance was compared with evaluations by expert clinicians using standardized cosmesis scoring systems.  Results: The AI-based system demonstrated high accuracy in detecting asymmetries and predicting cosmesis scores, with strong correlation to expert assessments (Pearson's r = 0.87, p < 0.001). The model provided consistent and reproducible evaluations, reducing interobserver variability.

A new deformation simulation algorithm for elastic-plastic objects based on splat primitives,Zou Y.; Liu P.X.,2017,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.02.007,"To achieve high computational efficiency and realistic visual effects, a new simulation algorithm for soft tissue deformation, which is based on a shape-matching scheme using splat primitives, is presented for interactive real-time applications, such as surgery simulation and video games. The most important novelty of the proposed approach lies in the fact that surface splats instead of points are employed in the computation of the deformation and fracturing of an elastic-plastic object. By controlling the sampling density and automatically adjusting the size of the circular splats, the surface of the simulated object can be seamlessly covered with a much small number of splats than points. Splats are then divided into clusters using the K-Means clustering algorithm. As a result, the elastic-plastic deformation of these clusters can be simulated using a shape-matching strategy, allowing more degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the simulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enormously reduces memory space and greatly improves computational efficiency (approximately twice in simulating plastic deformations compared with classical shape-matching methods), making it more suitable for interactive and real-time applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,

However, the measurement method used to measure the deflection angle of laser galvanometer in the narrow space of scanner with high precision remains to be studied. In this paper, an angle measurement method based on magnetic field is proposed, and the effect of the shapes of permanent magnets (PMs) on the measurement is studied by theoretical and experimental study under the condition that the maximum available space for the PMs is a 10mm side cube. An angle measuring experimental device is set up, and the contrast experiment is carried out with different PMs which are the same as simulation. The experimental results show that cylindrical PM is more suitable than other PMs, which is consistent with the simulation results, and the maximum nonlinearity error is 0.562%. This method has the advantages of small volume, non-contact measurement, small moment of inertia, good dynamic response and no external excitation for the PMs, so it has a broad application prospect in micro laser galvanometer scanner.

3D Reconstruction Model of an Extra-Abdominal Desmoid Tumor: A Case Study,Marinozzi F.; Carleo F.; Novelli S.; Di Martino M.; Cardillo G.; Petrella L.; Bini F.,2020,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2020.00518,"In recent years, three-dimensional reconstruction (3DR) models have become a standard tool in several medical fields such as education, surgical training simulation, patient–doctor communication, and surgical planning. Postoncologic reconstructive surgery in thoracic diseases might benefit from 3DR models; however, limited data on this application have been published worldwide. In this paper, the aim was to report our experience with 3DR modeling to determine resection and plan the surgical reconstruction in a patient with a desmoid tumor of the chest wall. For a better understanding of the case study, we describe all the steps from acquiring computed tomography (CT) scans to the final 3D rendering. A 68-year-old, non-smoking man presented at our outpatient department with painless swelling of the right anterobasal chest wall. A thorax–abdomen–brain CT scan revealed homogenous solid tissue with a dense mass measuring 80 mm × 62 mm. The final 3D model was evaluated by the surgical team (three medical doctors), who found the model to be powerful. Based on the results and the accuracy of the model, the multidisciplinary team decided that the tumor was resectable. Consequently, a surgical plan based on the 3D model was developed to perform chest wall reconstruction after radical resection. The patient underwent right anterolateral thoracotomy at the seventh intercostal space, which confirmed the CT scan findings and revealed infiltration of the serratus muscle and medial portion of the diaphragm. A radical tumor en bloc resection with chest wall and diaphragm resection was performed. The full-thickness chest wall and diaphragm defects were reconstructed using two separate biological patches of a porcine dermal collagen implant (Permacol™ Surgical Implant). Postoperative X-ray revealed unremarkable findings; the patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged 6 days after surgery. This case study illustrates that 3DR models enable a personalized approach to the treatment of desmoid tumors. Therefore, this approach should be developed further and studied systematically. © Copyright © 2020 Marinozzi, Carleo, Novelli, Di Martino, Cardillo, Petrella and Bini.",FALSE,
Critical buckling pressure of human abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in the range of physiological pressures and axial strains,Stoytchev S.; Nikolov S.; Antonova M.; Nenov M.,2019,Series on Biomechanics,,"Arteries are subjected to significant mechanical loads from internal blood flow and surround tissue tethering; thus their mechanical strength and stability are essential to normal arterial function. The mechanical stability of arteries in the last decade was investigated using animal experimental data only. The present work aims to expand studies to human AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysms) and compare results about the critical buckling pressure with those published in the literature. Preparations from human aneurysmal tissue were harvested by routine reconstructive operation and investigated by specially designed device in order to determine the corresponding stress-strain relation and Young's modulus. The AAA was assumed as an elastic cylinder whose diameter and length were estimated from CT images; the arterial pressure was taken from recordings during operation. Our simulations demonstrated that the determining factors of the critical pressure were the axial strain, the wall stiffness and the length of the AAA. The major result of the study was that in the physiological range of pressures and axial elongations the AAA is more likely to buckle than to rupture. The current investigation could be a useful tool to determine the critical axial strain needed in vascular reconstructive surgeries and vascular grafting in order to prevent tortuosity or kinking. © Series on Biomechanics 2019.

The method involves constructing a statistical shape model of the trunk from a training set of 3D reconstructions, capturing the variability of trunk shapes in scoliotic patients. Using this model, the postoperative trunk shape is predicted by estimating the shape parameters that best fit the expected surgical correction.

Multi-view stereo in the operating room allows prediction of healing complications in a patient-specific model of reconstructive surgery,Lee T.; Turin S.Y.; Gosain A.K.; Tepole A.B.,2018,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2018.04.004,"Excessive mechanical stress leads to wound healing complications following reconstructive surgery. However, this knowledge is not easily applicable in clinical scenarios due to the difficulty in measuring stress contours during complex tissue rearrangement procedures. Computational tools have been proposed as an alternative to address this need, but obtaining patient specific geometries with an affordable and flexible setup has remained a challenge. Here we present a methodology to determine the stress contours from a reconstructive procedure on a patient-specific finite element model based on multi-view stereo (MVS). MVS is a noninvasive technology that allows reconstruction of 3D geometries using a standard digital camera, making it ideal for the operating room. Finite element analysis can then be used on the patient-specific geometry to perform a virtual surgery and predict regions at risk of complications. We applied our approach to the case of a 7-year-old patient who was treated to correct a cranial contour deformity and resect two large areas of scalp scarring. The simulation showed several zones of high stress, particularly near the suture lines at the distal ends of the flaps. The patient did show delayed healing and partial flap tip necrosis at one of such predicted regions at the 30-day follow up visit. Our results further establish the application of computational tools in individualized medical scenarios to advance preoperative planing and anticipate regions of concern immediately after surgery. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,

Analysis of an early intervention tibial component for medial osteoarthritis,Chaudhary M.E.; Walker P.S.,2014,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.4027467,"Tibial component loosening is an important failure mode in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) which may be due to the 6-8 mm of bone resection required. To address component loosening and fixation, a new early intervention (EI) design is proposed which reverses the traditional material scheme between femoral and tibial components. The EI design consists of a plastic inlay for the distal femur and a thin metal plate for the proximal tibia. With this reversed materials scheme, the EI design requires minimal tibial bone resection compared with traditional UKA. This study investigated, by means of finite element (FE) simulations, the advantages of a thin metal tibial component compared with traditional UKA tibial components, such as an all-plastic inlay or a metal-backed onlay. We hypothesized that an EI tibial component would produce comparable stress, strain, and strain energy density (SED) characteristics to an intact knee and more favorable values than UKA components, due primarily to the preservation of dense cancellous bone near the surface. Indeed, FE results showed that stresses in the supporting bone for an EI design were close to intact, while stresses, strains, and strain energy densities were reduced compared with an all-plastic UKA component. Analyzed parameters were similar for an EI and a metal-backed onlay, but the EI component had the advantage of minimal resection of the stiffest bone. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.",FALSE,

A three-dimensional model of polyurethane sternum foam was created based on computed tomography images. Six different closure techniques using steel wire, steel bands and ZipFix bands were modeled on the sternum and transferred into a three-dimensional finite element model. The sternum was modeled as an isotropic bilinear-elasto-plastic material, and nonlinear contact conditions were applied. The models were analyzed under lateral distraction loading, and load-displacement curves were obtained from displacements at the incision line. Allowable loads and stiffness values of the methods were evaluated from these curves. The results showed the importance of the including material as well as geometric nonlinearities in the simulations to obtain realistic results from the numerical analyses.

From the rhombic transposition flap toward Z-plasty: An optimized design using the finite element method,Rajabi A.; Dolovich A.T.; Johnston J.D.,2015,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.08.021,"An optimized design for rhombic transposition flaps is created using a reliable finite element model that assures convergence for stress and deformation results. Defining a general configuration for rhombic flaps, the surgical process of wound closure is simulated for a wide variety of patterns. To address the intrinsic uncertainties associated with modelling skin's mechanical properties, four different sets of material parameters are considered, to investigate statistical measures. The results suggest that implementing the rhombic flap technique in a way similar to Z-plasty leads to an optimized surgical technique. The proposed flap, which can be employed for 60° to 90° rhombic defects, can reduce the maximum von Mises stress by 53% (on average) with respect to the Dufourmentel flap, and, in the case of a 60° defect, 43% with respect to the Limberg flap. To avoid any depressed area such as dog-ear formation, the maximum compressive principal stress is examined to assure that it remains within the limits of the stresses in the existing surgical techniques. The deformed configuration is also taken into consideration.

This sensor consists of five separate tactile cells with the same configuration, associated fixations, and holder parts. Each tactile cell is mainly composed of a spiral elastomer, a suspended optical fiber inscribed with an FBG element, and a contact head connecting the elastomer with a threaded connection. The two ends of the fiber were glued on the two sides of the spiral elastomer to form a tight suspension status. This configuration can effectively avoid the FBG chirping failure and achieve a higher sensitivity compared with the conventional direct FBG-pasting methods. The corresponding theoretical model has been derived, and the finite element method based simulation has been performed to facilitate the structure design and investigate both static and dynamic performances. Both static calibration experiments and dynamic loading experiments have been conducted to characterize the sensor's performance. The prototyped sensor can achieve a high resolution of up to 0.93 mN and is able to operate within a force measurement range of 0-5 N with a maximum relative error of less than 8.22%.

Tool to visualize and evaluate operator proficiency in laser hair-removal treatments,Noh S.; Koh W.S.; Lim H.-W.; Yoon C.; Kim Y.; Chung J.H.; Kim H.C.; Kim S.,2014,BioMedical Engineering Online,10.1186/1475-925X-13-40,"Background: The uniform delivery of laser energy is particularly important for safe and effective laser hair removal (LHR) treatment. Although it is necessary to quantitatively assess the spatial distribution of the delivered laser, laser spots are difficult to trace owing to a lack of visual cues. This study proposes a novel preclinic tool to evaluate operator proficiency in LHR treatment and applies this tool to train novice operators and compare two different treatment techniques (sliding versus spot-by-spot). Methods: A simulation bed is constructed to visualize the irradiated laser spots. Six novice operators are recruited to perform four sessions of simulation while changing the treatment techniques and the presence of feedback (sliding without feedback, sliding with feedback, spot-by-spot without feedback, and spot-by-spot with feedback). Laser distribution maps (LDMs) are reconstructed through a series of images processed from the recorded video for each simulation session. Then, an experienced dermatologist classifies the collected LDMs into three different performance groups, which are quantitatively analyzed in terms of four performance indices. Results: The performance groups are characterized by using a combination of four proposed indices. The best-performing group exhibited the lowest amount of randomness in laser delivery and accurate estimation of mean spot distances. The training was only effective in the sliding treatment technique. After the training, omission errors decreased by 6.32% and better estimation of the mean spot distance of the actual size of the laser-emitting window was achieved. Gels required operators to be trained when the spot-by-spot technique was used, and imposed difficulties in maintaining regular laser delivery when the sliding technique was used. Conclusions: Because the proposed system is simple and highly affordable, it is expected to benefit many operators in clinics to train and maintain skilled performance in LHR treatment, which will eventually lead to accomplishing a uniform laser delivery for safe and effective LHR treatment. © 2014 Noh et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",FALSE,

Finite element (FE) simulations of skin tissues have been shown to be a reliable tool in preoperative planning, yet, a major obstacle in the creation of predictive software comes from the inherent uncertainty in material properties of biological materials, and the high computational cost of creating and calibrating virtual surgery models. In this study we build computationally inexpensive surrogates to easily predict stress profiles for arbitrary material parameters and a range of defect sizes in three reconstructive scenarios: advancement, transposition, and rotation flaps. The surrogates are built by first creating a training data set of FE simulations that cover the input space of experimentally-determined skin properties from the literature. A reduced order representation of the training data set is achieved via principal component analysis, and computationally efficient surrogates are then created through Gaussian Process (GP) regression. We show that the GP surrogates predict stress contours with relative errors that are on average 2% in the l2-norm compared to the high-fidelity FE models. We apply the GP surrogates to predict differences in the probability densities of stress contours between two different age groups undergoing the same procedure. By replacing nonlinear FE models with accurate yet inexpensive models that can be evaluated for any combination of human skin material parameters and a range of defect sizes, we aim to enable calibration and prediction of stress contours in individualized clinical cases in the near future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,

Modeling the biomechanics of swine mastication - An inverse dynamics approach,Basafa E.; Murphy R.J.; Gordon C.R.; Armand M.,2014,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.05.019,"A novel reconstructive alternative for patients with severe facial structural deformity is Le Fort-based, face-jaw-teeth transplantation (FJTT). To date, however, only ten surgeries have included underlying skeletal and jaw-teeth components, all yielding sub-optimal results and a need for a subsequent revision surgery, due to size mismatch and lack of precise planning. Numerous studies have proven swine to be appropriate candidates for translational studies including pre-operative planning of transplantation. An important aspect of planning FJTT is determining the optimal muscle attachment sites on the recipient’s jaw, which requires a clear understanding of mastication and bite mechanics in relation to the new donated upper and/or lower jaw. A segmented CT scan coupled with data taken from literature defined a biomechanical model of mandible and jaw muscles of a swine. The model was driven using tracked motion and external force data of one cycle of chewing published earlier, and predicted the muscle activation patterns as well as temporomandibular joint (TMJ) reaction forces and condylar motions. Two methods, polynomial and min/max optimization, were used for solving the muscle recruitment problem. Similar performances were observed between the two methods. On average, there was a mean absolute error (MAE) of <0.08 between the predicted and measured activation levels of all muscles, and an MAE of <7. N for TMJ reaction forces. Simulated activations qualitatively followed the same patterns as the reference data and there was very good agreement for simulated TMJ forces. The polynomial optimization produced a smoother output, suggesting that it is more suitable for studying such motions. Average MAE for condylar motion was 1.2. mm, which reduced to 0.37. mm when the input incisor motion was scaled to reflect the possible size mismatch between the current and original swine models.

Methods The IDEAL stage 0 study included simulation of focal/hemiablation in whole-mount prostate specimens obtained from 100 men who had undergone radical prostatectomies, but met the criteria for focal/hemiablation. The IDEAL stage 1/2a was a prospective, single-arm, Institutional Review Board-approved study of precision prostatectomy undertaken in eight men, who met the predetermined criteria. Criteria for both stages included (1) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤15 ng/mL, (2) stage ≤cT2, (3) dominant unilateral lesion with Gleason ≤4+3 with any number of cores or % cores involved ipsilaterally on transrectal biopsy, (4) no primary Gleason ≥4 contralaterally on transrectal biopsy, and (5) preoperative erectile function score (International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5) of ≥17 (out of 25) without PDE-5i (applicable only to the stage 1/2a study participants). Feasibility and safety of the precision prostatectomy technique, and short-term urinary, sexual and oncological outcomes were studied. Results Analysis of whole-mount specimens in the 100 men showed an index lesion (>1 cm in diameter) in all. Ninety-eight men had satellite lesions smaller than 0.5 cm³ in volume - 46 on the side of the dominant lesions and 52 in the contralateral lobe. If the men in this modeling cohort had undergone focal ablation with a 5-10 mm untreated margin, all except one would have had at least Gleason 6 residual cancer. If they had undergone hemiablation with no untreated tissue on the ablated side, 56 men would have had residual cancer on the contralateral side, of whom 21 would have had clinically significant cancer (Gleason 7 or higher). If these men had undergone precision prostatectomy, with preservation of 5-10 mm of tissue on the non-dominant side, 10% and 4% would have had Gleason 3+4 and Gleason 4+3 disease left behind, respectively. For the stage 1/2a study, the median (IQR) age, PSA and IIEF-5 scores at the time of surgery were 54 (52-57) years, 4.4 (3.8-6.1) ng/mL and 24 (23-25), respectively. All eight patients were continent and sexually active at 12 months with a median IIEF-5 score of 21 (out of 25). At 24-30 months from surgery, the median PSA was 0.2 (range 0.1-0.7) ng/mL. Six men had undergone follow-up protocol biopsies, two, with undetectable PSA, had refused. Two men had residual Gleason 3+3 cancer, with PSA of 0.7 and 0.4 ng/mL, and remain on active surveillance. No man has undergone secondary whole-gland therapy. Conclusions Examination of whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens in men who fit the conventional criteria of focal/hemiablation showed that approximately 21%-68% of men would have clinically significant CaP in the untreated tissue.

Numerical and experimental investigations for the evaluation of the wear coefficient of reverse total shoulder prostheses,Mattei L.; Di Puccio F.; Joyce T.J.; Ciulli E.,2016,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.10.007,"In the present study, numerical and experimental wear investigations on reverse total shoulder arthroplasties (RTSAs) were combined in order to estimate specific wear coefficients, currently not available in the literature. A wear model previously developed by the authors for metal-on-plastic hip implants was adapted to RTSAs and applied in a double direction: firstly, to evaluate specific wear coefficients for RTSAs from experimental results and secondly, to predict wear distribution. In both cases, the Archard wear law (AR) and the wear law of UHMWPE (PE) were considered, assuming four different k functions. The results indicated that both the wear laws predict higher wear coefficients for RTSA with respect to hip implants, particularly the AR law, with k values higher than twofold the hip ones. Such differences can significantly affect predictive wear model results for RTSA, when non-specific wear coefficients are used. Moreover, the wear maps simulated with the two laws are markedly different, although providing the same wear volume. A higher wear depth (+51%) is obtained with the AR law, located at the dome of the cup, while with the PE law the most worn region is close to the edge. Taking advantage of the linear trend of experimental volume losses, the wear coefficients obtained with the AR law should be valid despite having neglected the geometry update in the model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",FALSE,

Many studies have demonstrated that the porous structure of an implant promotes bone ingrowth and its stiffness can be controlled via the design of the porosity. Although some researchers have paid attention to investigating the porous structure for dental implants, the biomechanical properties and osseointegration have not been well studied. In this study, finite element analysis and experiments have been used to evaluate the biomechanical performance and osseointegration of dental implants with porous/solid structures fabricated by selective laser melting using commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti, Grade 2). The implants were tested and the fracture surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscope to investigate the failure mechanisms. To reduce bone resorption, the porosity of dental implant was designed to optimize its stiffness. Finally, animal experiments revealed that bone tissue ingrowth was seen into the porous structure. It is believed that the porous dental implants have great potential in future applications. © IMechE 2018.",FALSE,
Finite-element design and optimization of a three-dimensional tetrahedral porous titanium scaffold for the reconstruction of mandibular defects,Luo D.; Rong Q.; Chen Q.,2017,Medical Engineering and Physics,10.1016/j.medengphy.2017.06.015,"Reconstruction of segmental defects in the mandible remains a challenge for maxillofacial surgery. The use of porous scaffolds is a potential method for repairing these defects. Now, additive manufacturing techniques provide a solution for the fabrication of porous scaffolds with specific geometrical shapes and complex structures. The goal of this study was to design and optimize a three-dimensional tetrahedral titanium scaffold for the reconstruction of mandibular defects. With a fixed strut diameter of 0.45 mm and a mean cell size of 2.2 mm, a tetrahedral structural porous scaffold was designed for a simulated anatomical defect derived from computed tomography (CT) data of a human mandible. An optimization method based on the concept of uniform stress was performed on the initial scaffold to realize a minimal-weight design. Geometric and mechanical comparisons between the initial and optimized scaffold show that the optimized scaffold exhibits a larger porosity, 81.90%, as well as a more homogeneous stress distribution. These results demonstrate that tetrahedral structural titanium scaffolds are feasible structures for repairing mandibular defects, and that the proposed optimization scheme has the ability to produce superior scaffolds for mandibular reconstruction with better stability, higher porosity, and less weight. © 2017 IPEM",FALSE,
Novel method for the detection of the facial nerve using electrical impedance spectroscopy during otologic surgery,Yun J.; Kim J.; Lee S.; Cho H.-H.; Lee J.-H.,2018,"Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical",10.1016/j.snb.2018.01.157,"Iatrogenic facial nerve injuries, which may occur during otologic surgery, can cause facial paralysis that eventually leads to devastating complications such as cosmetic problems, limitation to eye lubrication, and problems with eating, drinking, and speaking. We aimed to prevent iatrogenic nerve injury using an electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique and developed a facial nerve detector (FND) with coplanar bipolar electrodes on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate film using micro electro-mechanical systems technology. The discrimination capability of the FND was preliminarily evaluated by analyzing electrical impedances of solutions of various concentrations of phosphate-buffered saline and by extracting sample resistance using curve fitting with an electrical equivalent circuit. The impedances of bone, facial nerve covered by thin bone, and facial nerve of a cadaver were investigated using the optimal frequency range obtained based on the proposed discrimination index. To generalize the sensor output without regard to the shapes and dimensions of the EIS sensors, electrical conductivities of the samples were estimated by matching the extracted sample resistances with resistances obtained in the finite element method (FEM) simulation. Finally, in order to determine the location of the facial nerve before the facial nerve is exposed, resistance and conductivity changes were investigated using an FEM simulation based on the thickness of the bone covering the facial nerve. Thus, physicians can obtain information regarding the thickness of the bone covering the facial nerve while grinding the bone in otologic surgery. This will enable physicians to easily avoid iatrogenic facial nerve injury during otologic surgery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",FALSE,
Inter-subject variability effects on the primary stability of a short cementless femoral stem,Bah M.T.; Shi J.; Heller M.O.; Suchier Y.; Lefebvre F.; Young P.; King L.; Dunlop D.G.; Boettcher M.; Draper E.; Browne M.,2015,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.01.037,"This paper is concerned with the primary stability of the Furlong Evolution ® cementless short stem across a spectrum of patient morphology. A computational tool is developed that automatically selects and positions the most suitable stem from an implant system made of a total of 48 collarless stems to best match a 3D model based on a library of CT femur scans (75 males and 34 females). Finite Element contact models of reconstructed hips, subjected to physiologically-based boundary constraints and peak loads of walking mode, were simulated using a coefficient of friction of 0.4 and an interference-fit of 50μm. Maximum and average implant micromotions across the subpopulation were predicted to be 100±7μm and 7±5μm with ranges [15μm, 350μm] and [1μm, 25μm], respectively. The computed percentage of implant area with micromotions greater than reported critical values of 50μm, 100μm and 150μm never exceeded 14%, 8% and 7%, respectively. To explore the possible correlations between anatomy and implant performance, response surface models for micromotion metrics were constructed. Detailed morphological analyses were conducted and a clear nonlinear decreasing trend was observed between implant average micromotion and both the metaphyseal canal flare indices and average densities in Gruen zones. The present study demonstrates that the primary stability and tolerance of the short stem to variability in patient anatomy were high, reducing the need for patient stratification.

Sutured tendon repair; a multi-scale finite element model,Rawson S.D.; Margetts L.; Wong J.K.F.; Cartmell S.H.,2015,Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology,10.1007/s10237-014-0593-5,"Following rupture, tendons are sutured to reapproximate the severed ends and permit healing. Several repair techniques are employed clinically, with recent focus towards high-strength sutures, permitting early active mobilisation thus improving resultant joint mobility. However, the arrangement of suture repairs locally alters the loading environment experienced by the tendon. The extent of the augmented stress distribution and its effect on the tissue is unknown. Stress distribution cannot be established using traditional tensile testing, in vivo, or ex vivo study of suture repairs. We have developed a 3D finite element model of a Kessler suture repair employing multiscale modelling to represent tendon microstructure and incorporate its highly orthotropic behaviour into the tissue description. This was informed by ex vivo tensile testing of porcine flexor digitorum profundus tendon. The transverse modulus of the tendon was 0.2551 ± 0.0818 MPa and 0.1035 ± 0.0454 MPa in proximal and distal tendon samples, respectively, and the interfibrillar tissue modulus ranged from 0.1021 to 0.0416 MPa. We observed an elliptically shaped region of high stress around the suture anchor, consistent with a known region of acellularity which develop 72 h post-operatively and remain for at least a year. We also observed a stress shielded region close to the severed tendon ends, which may impair collagen fibre realignment during the remodelling stage of repair due to the lack of tensile stress. © 2014, The Author(s).",FALSE,
Volume manipulation for simulating facial contouring surgery,Tsai M.-D.; Tsai F.-C.; Lin C.-L.; Hsieh M.-S.,2014,"Biomedical Engineering - Applications, Basis and Communications",10.4015/S1016237214500161,"In facial contouring surgery, surgeons operate the facial bone to correct bone morphology and thus achieve esthetic feminine face. To evaluate the face appearance after surgery and rehearse every surgical procedure in facial contouring surgery, simulations for tissue peeling, incising and suturing on the face together with bone burring and grafting on the facial bone are required. This paper presents a method that transforms respective tissue vertices to simulate tissue peeling. The transformation is based on specified incisions and clamps as in real facial contouring surgery. This paper also uses an auxiliary structure to represent and record tissue boundary changes inside the face. The elastic, partially plastic and plastic tissue deformation and wound formation during an incision can be simulated by manipulating these boundary changes. The incised wound recorded in the auxiliary structure is also manipulated to simulate tissue generation in wound healing during a suture. This volume manipulation method is combined with the reported method for bone burring and grafting simulations so that high-quality 3D images for illustrating surgical procedures both on the face and facial bone can be achieved. Simulations of two case examples including tissue peeling, incising and suturing procedures, and three modalities of facial contouring surgery demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and system. © 2014 National Taiwan University.",FALSE,

We evaluated a 3-dimensional, haptic, virtual reality temporal bone simulator for dissection training. Methods: The subjects were 7 otolaryngology residents (3 training sessions each) and 7 medical students (1 training session each). The virtual reality temporal bone simulation station included a computer with software that was linked to a force-feedback hand stylus, and the system recorded performance and collisions with vital anatomic structures. Subjects performed virtual reality dissections and completed questionnaires after the training sessions. Results: Residents and students had favorable responses to most questions of the technology acceptance model (TAM) questionnaire. The average TAM scores were above neutral for residents and medical students in all domains, and the average TAM score for residents was significantly higher for the usefulness domain and lower for the playful domain than students. The average satisfaction questionnaire for residents showed that residents had greater overall satisfaction with cadaver temporal bone dissection training than training with the virtual reality simulator or plastic temporal bone. For medical students, the average comprehension score was significantly increased from before to after training for all anatomic structures.

The proposed model included the tibia-femoral and patella-femoral joints, articular cartilage and menisci. Key surgical parameters were incorporated including bone-patellar-tendon-bone graft excision and pre-tensioning, tunnel morphology, bone plugs, and bone plug fixation. Several simulation steps were parameterized to reflect the clinically reported surgical procedure. Our focus was to explore the intra-operative effects of variations in tunnel directions on the selected metrics of joint mechanics during Lachman and Anterior Drawer tests. A mathematical construct capable of transforming the limited and heterogeneous experimental and surgical data to evidence-based validation was adopted to ensure the viability of the finite element models. We found that the proposed models, subject to a variation in tunnel directions, resulted in simulation outputs that favor the reported experimental data of Lachman and Anterior Drawer tests under uncertainty. Simulation results for a population of three-dimensional tunnel orientations provided insights into the graft-tunnel contact mechanics and the spatial stress distribution in the graft, insights that have been anecdotally observed in prior experimental studies. The intraarticular graft tension was found to be higher than the estimated in tunnel graft force, and larger differences were found for the least inclined tunnels exhibiting higher contact pressures, transverse bending and twisting of the graft and Von-Mises stress at the graft-femoral tunnel interface. Conversely, tunnels with high inclination angles exhibited higher intraarticular graft tension and Von-Mises stress at the graft-tibial bone plug interface. © 2014.",FALSE,

One solution to this problem is to use computer-guided surgical planning and additive manufacturing technology to produce patient-specific reconstruction plates. However, when designing customized plates, it is important to assess potential biomechanical responses that may vary substantially depending on the size and geometry of the defect. The aim of this study was to assess the design of two customized plates using finite element method (FEM). These plates were designed for the reconstruction of the lower left mandibles of two ameloblastoma cases (patient 1/plate 1 and patient 2/plate 2) with large bone resections differing in both geometry and size. Simulations revealed maximum von Mises stresses of 63. MPa and 108. MPa in plates 1 and 2, and 65. MPa and 190. MPa in the fixation screws of patients 1 and 2. The equivalent strain induced in the bone at the screw-bone interface reached maximum values of 2739 micro-strain for patient 1 and 19,575 micro-strain for patient 2. The results demonstrate the influence of design on the stresses induced in the plate and screw bodies. Of particular note, however, are the differences in the induced strains. Unphysiologically high strains in bone adjacent to screws can cause micro-damage leading to bone resorption. This can adversely affect the anchoring capabilities of the screws. Thus, while custom plates offer optimal anatomical fit, attention should be paid to the expected physiological forces on the plates and the induced stresses and strains in the plate-screw-bone assembly. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",FALSE,
Improving tissue expansion protocols through computational modeling,Lee T.; Vaca E.E.; Ledwon J.K.; Bae H.; Topczewska J.M.; Turin S.Y.; Kuhl E.; Gosain A.K.; Tepole A.B.,2018,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2018.03.034,"Tissue expansion is a common technique in reconstructive surgery used to grow skin in vivo for correction of large defects. Despite its popularity, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of how stretch leads to growth of new skin. This has resulted in several arbitrary expansion protocols that rely on the surgeon's personal training and experience rather than on accurate predictive models. For example, choosing between slow or rapid expansion, or small or large inflation volumes remains controversial. Here we explore four tissue expansion protocols by systematically varying the inflation volume and the protocol duration in a porcine model. The quantitative analysis combines three-dimensional photography, isogeometric kinematics, and finite growth theory. Strikingly, all four protocols generate similar peak stretches, but different growth patterns: Smaller filling volumes of 30 ml per inflation did not result in notable expander-induced growth neither for the short nor for the long protocol; larger filling volumes of 60 ml per inflation trigger skin adaptation, with larger expander-induced growth in regions of larger stretch, and more expander-induced growth for the 14-day compared to the 10-day expansion protocol. Our results suggest that expander-induced growth is not triggered by the local stretch alone. While stretch is clearly a driver for growth, the local stretch at a given point is not enough to predict the expander-induced growth at that location. From a clinical perspective, our study suggests that longer expansion protocols are needed to ensure sufficient growth of sizable skin patches. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,

We propose three quantitative shape indicators - volume ratio, contour error, and maximum projection - for symmetrical lesions of the mandible, and have implemented a parallel computation algorithm for the semiautomatic placement of fibular segments.

Friction coefficient and effective interference at the implant-bone interface,Damm N.B.; Morlock M.M.; Bishop N.E.,2015,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.07.012,"Although the contact pressure increases during implantation of a wedge-shaped implant, friction coefficients tend to be measured under constant contact pressure, as endorsed in standard procedures. Abrasion and plastic deformation of the bone during implantation are rarely reported, although they define the effective interference, by reducing the nominal interference between implant and bone cavity. In this study radial forces were analysed during simulated implantation and explantation of angled porous and polished implant surfaces against trabecular bone specimens, to determine the corresponding friction coefficients. Permanent deformation was also analysed to determine the effective interference after implantation. For the most porous surface tested, the friction coefficient initially increased with increasing normal contact stress during implantation and then decreased at higher contact stresses. For a less porous surface, the friction coefficient increased continually with normal contact stress during implantation but did not reach the peak magnitude measured for the rougher surface. Friction coefficients for the polished surface were independent of normal contact stress and much lower than for the porous surfaces. Friction coefficients were slightly lower for pull-out than for push-in for the porous surfaces but not for the polished surface. The effective interference was as little as 30% of the nominal interference for the porous surfaces. The determined variation in friction coefficient with radial contact force, as well as the loss of interference during implantation will enable a more accurate representation of implant press-fitting for simulations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",FALSE,

Breast-conserving surgery provides a prime illustration of this aim, since remaining cancer in breast margins results in multiple surgeries, while removal of too much unaffected tissue often has undesirable cosmetic effects. Similarly, resection of benign lymph nodes during sentinel lymph node biopsy can cause deleterious health outcomes. The objective of this study was to create an intraoperative, in vivo device to address these challenges. Instant diagnostic information generated by this device could allow surgeons to precisely and completely remove all malignant tissue during the first surgery. Surgical forceps based on Martin forceps were instrumented at the tips with high-frequency ultrasonic transducers composed of polyvinylidene difluoride, a thickness-sensing rotary potentiometer at the base, and a spring to provide the appropriate restoring force. Transducer wires within the forceps were connected to an external high-frequency pulser-receiver, activating the forceps' transmitting transducer at 50 MHz and amplifying through-transmission signals from the receiving transducer. The forceps were tested with tissue-mimicking agarose phantoms embedded with 58-550 μm polyethylene microspheres to simulate various stages of cancer progression and to provide a range of measurement values. Results were compared with measurements from standard 50 MHz immersion transducers. The results showed that the forceps displayed similar sensitivity for attenuation and increased accuracy for wave speed.

Thus, the forceps with the elastomer can be considered a compliant component, which provides tiny displacements that allow large strain, and the overall diameter is 10 mm. The sizes of the elastomer and forceps are successively determined by analyzing the relationship of several parameters and strain. Then, the linearity analysis of strain beams determines the positions to apply gauges for sensing. The two-dimensional force decoupling models for a single microgripper are proposed based on piecewise analytical polynomials of the strain difference and employed to develop a new three-dimensional force nonlinear decoupling algorithm based on double microgrippers, which realizes single-axial grasping and three-axial pulling forces. Finally, the required force-sensing performance of the proposed method is successfully verified in theory using finite-element simulations. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.",FALSE,
Study of mandible reconstruction using a fibula flap with application of additive manufacturing technology,Tsai M.-J.; Wu C.-T.,2014,BioMedical Engineering Online,10.1186/1475-925X-13-57,"Background: This study aimed to establish surgical guiding techniques for completing mandible lesion resection and reconstruction of the mandible defect area with fibula sections in one surgery by applying additive manufacturing technology, which can reduce the surgical duration and enhance the surgical accuracy and success rate. Methods: A computer assisted mandible reconstruction planning (CAMRP) program was used to calculate the optimal cutting length and number of fibula pieces and design the fixtures for mandible cutting, registration, and arrangement of the fibula segments. The mandible cutting and registering fixtures were then generated using an additive manufacturing system. The CAMRP calculated the optimal fibula cutting length and number of segments based on the location and length of the defective portion of the mandible. The mandible cutting jig was generated according to the boundary surface of the lesion resection on the mandible STL model. The fibular cutting fixture was based on the length of each segment, and the registered fixture was used to quickly arrange the fibula pieces into the shape of the defect area. In this study, the mandibular lesion was reconstructed using registered fibular sections in one step, and the method is very easy to perform. Results and conclusion: The application of additive manufacturing technology provided customized models and the cutting fixtures and registered fixtures, which can improve the efficiency of clinical application. This study showed that the cutting fixture helped to rapidly complete lesion resection and fibula cutting, and the registered fixture enabled arrangement of the fibula pieces and allowed completion of the mandible reconstruction in a timely manner. Our method can overcome the disadvantages of traditional surgery, which requires a long and different course of treatment and is liable to cause error. With the help of optimal cutting planning by the CAMRP and the 3D printed mandible resection jig and fibula cutting fixture, this all-in-one process of mandible reconstruction furnishes many benefits in this field by enhancing the accuracy of surgery, shortening the operation duration, reducing the surgical risk, and resulting in a better mandible appearance of the patients after surgery. © 2014 Tsai and Wu; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",FALSE,

The Incompatibility of Living Systems: Characterizing Growth-Induced Incompatibilities in Expanded Skin,Buganza Tepole A.; Gart M.; Purnell C.A.; Gosain A.K.; Kuhl E.,2016,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10439-015-1467-4,"Skin expansion is a common surgical technique to correct large cutaneous defects. Selecting a successful expansion protocol is solely based on the experience and personal preference of the operating surgeon. Skin expansion could be improved by predictive computational simulations. Towards this goal, we model skin expansion using the continuum framework of finite growth. This approach crucially relies on the concept of incompatible configurations. However, aside from the classical opening angle experiment, our current understanding of growth-induced incompatibilities remains rather vague. Here we visualize and characterize incompatibilities in living systems using skin expansion in a porcine model: We implanted and inflated two expanders, crescent, and spherical, and filled them to 225 cc throughout a period of 21 days. To quantify the residual strains developed during this period, we excised the expanded skin patches and subdivided them into smaller pieces. Skin growth averaged 1.17 times the original area for the spherical and 1.10 for the crescent expander, and displayed significant regional variations. When subdivided into smaller pieces, the grown skin patches retracted heterogeneously and confirmed the existence of incompatibilities. Understanding skin growth through mechanical stretch will allow surgeons to improve—and ultimately personalize—preoperative treatment planning in plastic and reconstructive surgery. © 2015, Biomedical Engineering Society.",FALSE,
Optimization of the flexural rigidity of a concentric pipe used in transmitting rotation for arc-shaped forceps,Noda S.; Takayama T.; Omata T.,2017,ROBOMECH Journal,10.1186/s40648-017-0077-3,"Arc-shaped forceps are important in pharyngeal cancer surgery, endoscopic sinus surgery, and single port surgery. Rotating the gripper of an arc-shaped forceps with respect to its shaft axis can improve the manipulability of the forceps. Concentric pipe structures consisting of inner and outer pipes are often used for this purpose. The inner pipe transmits rotations from its proximal end to distal end. However, the shape of the bent inner pipe is generally different from that of the outer pipe, and this causes large friction between the outer and inner pipes. To reduce friction, a plastic tube is often used for the inner pipe. However, since its torsional rigidity is low, this results in a large twist angle. This paper proposes a procedure to fit a metal bent inner pipe to an outer pipe by adjusting the flexural rigidity of the inner pipe with slits to reduce the friction. The procedure minimizes the twist angle between the proximal and distal end of the arc-shaped forceps by reducing the torque required to rotate its metal inner pipe. We develop a 5 mm forceps with a 3.5 mm inner pipe. The twist angle is 2.8° when a load torque of 20 Nmm is applied, which is a typical load torque for suturing, whereas the twist angle of a PEEK (polyetheretherketone) inner pipe is 24.3° in simulation. Ex vivo experiments show that the required forceps torque is small in simulated clinical scenarios. © 2017, The Author(s).",FALSE,
Characterization and assessment of hyperelastic and elastic properties of decellularized human adipose tissues,Omidi E.; Fuetterer L.; Reza Mousavi S.; Armstrong R.C.; Flynn L.E.; Samani A.,2014,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.09.035,"Decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) has shown potential as a regenerative scaffold for plastic and reconstructive surgery to augment or replace damaged or missing adipose tissue (e.g. following lumpectomy or mastectomy). The mechanical properties of soft tissue substitutes are of paramount importance in restoring the natural shape and appearance of the affected tissues, and mechanical mismatching can lead to unpredictable scar tissue formation and poor implant integration. The goal of this work was to assess the linear elastic and hyperelastic properties of decellularized human adipose tissue and compare them to those of normal breast adipose tissue. To assess the influence of the adipose depot source on the mechanical properties of the resultant decellularized scaffolds, we performed indentation tests on DAT samples sourced from adipose tissue isolated from the breast, subcutaneous abdominal region, omentum, pericardial depot and thymic remnant, and their corresponding force-displacement data were acquired. Elastic and hyperelastic parameters were estimated using inverse finite element algorithms. Subsequently, a simulation was conducted in which the estimated hyperelastic parameters were tested in a real human breast model under gravity loading in order to assess the suitability of the scaffolds for implantation. Results of these tests showed that in the human breast, the DAT would show similar deformability to that of native normal tissue. Using the measured hyperelastic parameters, we were able to assess whether DAT derived from different depots exhibited different intrinsic nonlinearities. Results showed that DAT sourced from varying regions of the body exhibited little intrinsic nonlinearity, with no statistically significant differences between the groups. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",FALSE,
Mechanical properties of PVA material for tissue engineering applications,Karimi A.; Navidbakhsh M.,2014,Materials Technology,10.1179/1753555713Y.0000000115,"The paper presents the first scientific study of the quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) sponges. The PVA sponges have been considered as a potential implant material for replacement and repair of the soft tissues, including cartilage, liver and kidney. It is also used in ophthalmic surgical treatment, such as Lasik, cataract and refractive surgeries, to manipulate tissue during incision procedures in the eye to absorb fluid. However, a critical barrier to the use of the PVA sponge as a tissue replacement material is the lack of sufficient mechanical properties. In this study, the non-linear mechanical behaviour of a PVA sponge is investigated experimentally and computationally. A series of tension tests are designed and conducted for the PVA sponge. Hyperelastic strain energy density functions, including Yeoh, Ogden, Mooney-Rivlin and Neo-Hookean, are calibrated using the experimental data. A hyperelastic constitutive model is selected to best fit the axial behaviour of the sponge. Its general prediction ability is verified using finite element simulations of PVA tensile experiments. The results in terms of the maximum stress before the holding for the P sponge demonstrate that it can bear 11–94% and 20–17% more stress compared to the EYETEC and CENEFOM sponges respectively. The swelling ratio of the P sponge was 26–78 and 1–78% more than that of the CENEFOM and EYETEC sponges respectively. Moreover, the Yeoh model was selected to represent the non-linear behaviour of the PVA material, which can be used in future biomechanical simulations of the soft tissues. These results can be utilised to understand the QLV and swelling mechanism of PVA sponges and have implications for ophthalmic and plastic surgeries, as well as wound healing and tissue engineering purposes. © 2014 W.

In this study, the biomechanical behavior of 10 canine humeri was compared before and after creation of a 10 mm bone defect stabilized with an eight-hole locking compression plate (Synthes®) and two locking screws on each fragment. The response under compression of both intact and plated samples was measured experimentally and reproduced with a finite element model.

Design and modelling of a variable stiffness manipulator for surgical robots,Le H.M.; Cao L.; Do T.N.; Phee S.J.,2018,Mechatronics,10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.05.012,"In Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), a surgical robot that can access the human colon or stomach via natural orifices should have sufficient flexibility to pass through tortuous paths and to be operated in a confined space. In addition, the robot should possess an acceptable stiffness level to hold payloads during the surgery. This paper presents a new design concept for variable stiffness manipulators using thermoplastic material Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and a flexible stainless steel sheath as a heating media. The stiffness phases of PET can be actively adjusted through temperature. Experiments at different conditions showed that the proposed design was at least as flexible as a typical commercial endoscope in compliant mode and at least 9 times stiffer than the endoscope in stiff mode. In addition, flexural modulus of the proposed manipulator with respect to temperature, current, and time was modeled and validated through both simulation and experiments. A tendon-driven flexible robotic arm integrated with a variable stiffness spine was also developed, and ex vivo tests on fresh porcine tissue were conducted. The manipulator in compliant mode can be easily controlled through the tendons, and it is able to hold its shape against considerably large loads in stiff mode. The results demonstrate not only the high potential of the design concept for the future medical application but also the first steps toward building a complete surgical robotic system with fully controlled variable stiffness. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,
Propagation of material behavior uncertainty in a nonlinear finite element model of reconstructive surgery,Lee T.; Turin S.Y.; Gosain A.K.; Bilionis I.; Buganza Tepole A.,2018,Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology,10.1007/s10237-018-1061-4,"Excessive mechanical stress following surgery can lead to delayed healing, hypertrophic scars, and even skin necrosis. Measuring stress directly in the operating room over large skin areas is not feasible, and nonlinear finite element simulations have become an appealing alternative to predict stress contours on arbitrary geometries. However, this approach has been limited to generic cases, when in reality each patient geometry and procedure are unique, and material properties change from one person to another. In this manuscript, we use multi-view stereo to capture the patient-specific geometry of a 7-year-old female undergoing cranioplasty and complex tissue rearrangement. The geometry is used to setup a nonlinear finite element simulation of the reconstructive procedure. A key contribution of this work is incorporation of material behavior uncertainty. The finite element simulation is computationally expensive, and it is not suitable for uncertainty propagation which would require many such simulations. Instead, we run only a few expensive simulations in order to build a surrogate model by Gaussian process regression of the principal components of the stress fields computed with these few samples. The inexpensive surrogate is then used to compute the statistics of the stress distribution in this patient-specific scenario. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",FALSE,

The proposed approach is applied on a real-world problem in the domain of biomedicine - prediction of inner knee temperatures during therapeutic cooling (cryotherapy) after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery. A validated simulation model of the cryotherapeutic treatment is used to generate a substantial amount of diverse data from different simulation scenarios. We apply machine learning methods on the simulated data to construct a predictive model that provides a prediction for the inner temperature variable based on other system variables whose measurement is more feasible, i.e. skin temperatures. First, we perform feature ranking using the RReliefF method. Next, based on the feature ranking results, we investigate the predictive performance and time/memory efficiency of several predictive modeling methods: linear regression, regression trees, model trees, and ensembles of regression and model trees. Results have shown that using only temperatures from skin sensors as input attributes gives excellent prediction for the temperature in the knee center. Moreover, satisfying predictive accuracy is also achieved using short history of temperatures from just two skin sensors (placed anterior and posterior to the knee) as input variables. The model trees perform the best with prediction error in the same range as the accuracy of the simulated data (0.1. °C). Furthermore, they satisfy the requirements for small memory size and real-time response.

Simulating contact using the elastic foundation algorithm in OpenSim,Hast M.W.; Hanson B.G.; Baxter J.R.,2019,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2018.11.025,"Modeling joint contact in OpenSim is not well understood. This study systematically investigated the variables associated with the elastic foundation contact model within OpenSim by performing a series of controlled benchtop experiment and concomitant simulations. Four metal-on-plastic interactions were modeled, including a model of a total knee replacement (TKR). Load-displacement curves were recorded during cyclic loading between 100 and 750 N. Geometries were imported and into OpenSim and contact mechanics were modeled with the on-board elastic foundation algorithm. A hybrid optimization algorithm determined that stiffness and dissipation coefficients for TKR implants were 1.52 × 10^10 N/m and 57.7 Ns/m, respectively. Estimations of contact forces were 10.2% of blinded experimental data (average root mean square error: 76.82 ± 11.47 N). In the second portion of this study, freely available eTibia TKR renderings were used to test the ubiquity of the tuning parameters. They were also used to perform a sensitivity analysis of material stiffness and mesh density with regard to penetration depth and computational time. When a stiffness of 1 × 10^10 was applied to an eTibia model with 5000 faces, a 100 kg load caused 0.259 mm of penetration. Under the same conditions, the tuned model experienced 0.300 mm of penetration. Material stiffnesses between 1 × 10^13 and 1 × 10^15 N/m increased computation time by factors of 12–23. This study provides much needed clarity regarding the use of the OpenSim EF algorithm. It also demonstrates the utility of OpenSim to model deformable materials and complex geometries, and this approach can be adapted to make reasonable estimations for both natural and surgically modified joints. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,

Methods: In addition to a standard static clinical evaluation (anamnesis, radiological examination), the software provides a dynamic assessment of the shoulder joint by computing in real time the joint kinematics from a database of activities of daily living. During motion, the precise bone resection (location and amount) is computed based on detected subacromial impingements, providing surgeons with precise information about the surgical procedure. Moreover, to improve the subjective reading of medical images, the software provides 3D measurement tools based on anatomical models assisting in the analysis of shoulder morphological features. Results: We performed an in vivo assessment of the software in a prospective randomized clinical study conducted with 27 patients beneficiating from the planning solution and a control group of 31 patients without planning. Postoperatively, patient’s pain decreased, and the shoulder range of motion and the functional outcomes improved significantly and the rotator cuff healing rate was good for both groups without intergroup differences. The amount of bone resected at surgery was comparable between the groups. The percentage of remaining impingement after surgery was in average reduced to 51% without groups difference.

Shape-Locking Mechanism of Flexible Joint Using Mechanical Latch with Electromagnetic Force,Chung D.G.; Kim J.; Baek D.; Kim J.; Kwon D.-S.,2019,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,10.1109/LRA.2019.2897006,"Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has emerged as a procedure to further improve cosmetic profits and reduce the postoperative pain of multiport laparoscopic surgery. However, SILS is a difficult operation due to the limited workspace or accessibility. To improve surgical convenience, flexible surgical robots should be developed and applied to SILS for a large workspace. Flexible robots would penetrate a single incision point around the navel area and can provide a large workspace within the abdominal cavity. However, it is difficult to support the force required for surgical intervention during this process. In this study, a novel mechanism to lock the shape of a flexible joint to support the external forces during SILS is proposed. The developed shape-locking mechanism involves placing a latch between the joints; the shape locks by engagement of the latches via an electromagnetic force. The mechanism is implemented through mechanical coupling, so it can withstand large loads. Furthermore, the driving force of the mechanism is small because it only needs to engage the latch structure.

Prediction of insertion torque and stiffness of a dental implant in bovine trabecular bone using explicit micro-finite element analysis,Ovesy M.; Indermaur M.; Zysset P.K.,2019,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.06.024,"The assessment of dental implant performance is dominated by the concept of mechanical stability. Primary stability is defined as the capacity of a bone-implant structure to bear loads without occurrence of excessive damage and loosening. In order to achieve the highest primary stability, dental implants are inserted into bone using a press-fit procedure. Pre- and postoperative evaluation of primary stability using implantation torque and resonance frequency analysis are valid approaches but do not allow the systematic comparison of different protocols in similar situations. The aim of this research is to develop and validate an explicit, micro-finite element (μFE) methodology to study the effect of different amounts of initial press-fit on implantation torque and initial stiffness of a dental implant. Ten bovine trabecular bone samples were prepared that cover a wide range of bone volume fraction. A dental implant was inserted using two implantation protocols named soft (small initial drilled hole) and dense (increased initial drilled hole). The implantation torque was measured and the stiffness was calculated using an infinitesimal off-axis loading. Finite element simulations of the implant insertion and subsequent loading were performed on micro-computed tomography (μCT) reconstructions of the samples using an explicit solver. Bone was defined as an elasto-plastic material with von Mises yield criteria and hardening. Element deletion was triggered by a threshold in cumulated plastic strains. A sensitivity analysis was performed on friction, hardening and fracture strain to provide a better insight into the effects of these parameters on the results. The implantation torque required for the soft protocol was higher compared to the dense approach in both experiment and simulation due to the higher amount of bone compaction in the first approach. Interestingly, stiffness did not show a significant dependency on the drilling protocol in both experiment and simulation. In conclusion, the explicit microFE methodology developed in this study was able to capture the outcome of two drilling protocols in terms of torque and stiffness and represents a powerful tool to explore the effect of different parameters on primary stability of dental implants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,

Multifactorial sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the relative influence of these surgical factors on the intraoperative joint laxity, graft-tunnel contact mechanics and graft forces. The sensitivity results indicated that the combined variation in tunnel architecture and graft pre-tension at the time of fixation accounts for most of the estimated variance of the three outcomes. Joint laxity was largely influenced by tunnel placement with a modest contribution of the pre-tensioning force. However, variations in pre-tensioning force yielded a significant effect on both the in tunnel and intra-articular graft forces. Tunnel directions played the dominant role in the expressions of the contact shear between the graft and tunnel aperture in the fully extended and reconstructed joint. Given the proposed significance of the shear mediated graft abrasion at the graft-tunnel aperture, these sensitivity results are consistent with the general observation in the Multicenter ACL Revision Study (MARS), femoral tunnel architecture is most correlated with incidences of graft failures. Tunnel direction and graft pre-tension had similar effect on the estimated variance of the contact pressure in the fully extended joint. Data derived from the 48 ACL reconstructed models indicated that the anatomic surgical design may not be the only design that recovers the healthy joint laxity. In the context of the design of prospective studies, our findings highlight the need to include the graft tension and not fixation angle at the time of fixation as a variable in the evaluation of the surgery. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,
Video-tactile pneumatic sensor for soft tissue elastic modulus estimation,Gubenko M.M.; Morozov A.V.; Lyubicheva A.N.; Goryacheva I.G.; Dosaev M.Z.; Ju M.-S.; Yeh C.H.; Su F.-C.,2017,BioMedical Engineering Online,10.1186/s12938-017-0390-3,"Background: A new sensor for estimating elasticity of soft tissues such as a liver was developed for minimally invasive surgery application. Methods: By measuring deformation and adjusting internal pressure of the pneumatic sensor head, the sensor can be used to do palpation (indentation) of tissues with wide range of stiffness. A video camera installed within the sensor shell is used to register the radius of the contact area. Based on finite element model simulations and the measured data, elastic modulus of the indented soft tissue can be calculated. Results and conclusions: Three phantom materials, namely plastic, silicone and gelatin, with varied stiffness were tested. The experimental results demonstrated that the new sensor can obtain highly reliable data with error less than 5%.

Feasibility of using bulk metallic glass for self-expandable stent applications,Praveen Kumar G.; Jafary-Zadeh M.; Tavakoli R.; Cui F.,2017,Journal of Biomedical Materials Research - Part B Applied Biomaterials,10.1002/jbm.b.33718,"Self-expandable stents are widely used to restore blood flow in a diseased artery segment by keeping the artery open after angioplasty. Despite the prevalent use of conventional crystalline metallic alloys, for example, nitinol, to construct self-expandable stents, new biomaterials such as bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are being actively pursued to improve stent performance. Here, we conducted a series of analyses including finite element analysis and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the feasibility of using a prototypical Zr-based BMG for self-expandable stent applications. We model stent crimping of several designs for different percutaneous applications. Our results indicate that BMG-based stents with diamond-shaped crowns suffer from severe localization of plastic deformation and abrupt failure during crimping. As a possible solution, we further illustrate that such abrupt failure could be avoided in BMG-based stents without diamond shape crowns.

Design and fluid flow simulation of modified laparoscopic forceps,Junaidi M.A.R.; Kalluri R.C.M.; Rao Y.V.D.; Gokhale A.G.K.; Patel A.,2021,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1080/10255842.2020.1855331,"Laparoscopic surgery has gained prominence in recent decades and employed in minimally invasive surgeries to avoid massive cuts resulting in a reduction in pain, the chance of infection, and duration of stay in the hospital. Maryland forceps, which belongs to the category of grasper instruments, are often used in minimally invasive surgeries to hold, pull, push, manipulate, and perform dissection operations. During laparoscopic surgeries, often blood and other body fluids ooze from the site of surgery. Typically, suction–irrigation (SI) devices are used to periodically clear these fluids to get a better view of the site of surgery. To achieve this, the removal and insertion of multiple instruments are required. This process has to be repeated numerous times, which significantly increases the time needed for surgery. Literature survey and feedback from practicing surgeons suggest that this can be avoided by improving the current design of forceps. In this article, a modified design is proposed by combining the SI feature with the existing form of Maryland forceps. The modified design is first modeled in SolidWorks and then analyzed for fluid flow using ANSYS Fluent. Parametric analysis is performed to obtain the optimal design for the proposed multi-functional instrument, which can potentially improve the overall efficiency of the laparoscopic surgical process. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",FALSE,
Subject-specific finite-element modeling of normal aortic valve biomechanics from 3D+t TEE images,Labrosse M.R.; Beller C.J.; Boodhwani M.; Hudson C.; Sohmer B.,2015,Medical Image Analysis,10.1016/j.media.2014.11.003,"In the past decades, developments in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have opened new horizons in reconstructive surgery of the aortic valve (AV), whereby corrections are made to normalize the geometry and function of the valve, and effectively treat leaks. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first integrated framework to process subject-specific 3D+t TEE AV data, determine age-matched material properties for the aortic and leaflet tissues, build a finite element model of the unpressurized AV, and simulate the AV function throughout a cardiac cycle. For geometric reconstruction purposes, dedicated software was created to acquire the 3-D coordinates of 21 anatomical landmarks of the AV apparatus in a systematic fashion. Measurements from ten 3D+t TEE datasets of normal AVs were assessed for inter- and intra-observer variability. These tests demonstrated mean measurement errors well within the acceptable range. Simulation of a complete cardiac cycle was successful for all ten valves and validated the novel schemes introduced to evaluate age-matched material properties and iteratively scale the unpressurized dimensions of the valves such that, given the determined material properties, the dimensions measured in vivo closely matched those simulated in late diastole. The leaflet coaptation area, describing the quality of the sealing of the valve, was measured directly from the medical images and was also obtained from the simulations; both approaches correlated well. The mechanical stress values obtained from the simulations may be interpreted in a comparative sense whereby higher values are indicative of higher risk of tearing and/or development of calcification. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",FALSE,
New synthetic mitral valve model for human prolapsed mitral valve reconstructive surgery for training,Goode D.; Mohammadi S.; Taheri R.; Mohammadi H.,2020,Journal of Medical Engineering and Technology,10.1080/03091902.2020.1753837,"The training process of young surgeons is highly desirable in order for them to gain an understanding of the quality of care and patient safety required during cardiac surgeries, however, it may take a few years of practice in order for them to properly develop these skills. Artificial life-like platforms and models are extremely recommended for teaching hands-on and real-world practice in both junior and even experienced medical professionals and surgeons. Suitable and accessible training tools are of significant importance for simulating a particular surgery in order to provide practice opportunities for a specific surgical procedure. In this study, we focussed on the simulation of the human mitral valve prolapse reconstructive surgery. An innovative, artificial, biomimetic model was designed and fabricated made of Cryogel biomaterial developed in our lab that is suitable for the precise practice on the mitral valve prolapse model. The proposed model is mainly made up of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) cryogel, which is designed to resemble the geometric and mechanical properties of a diseased (prolapse) mitral valve. We simulated the constructive prolapsed mitral valve surgery entirely on a synthetic platform. The platform was made available to four certified cardiac surgeon and there were unanimously very positive with no considerable differences in the procedural assessments between them. The proposed model has a similar appearance and texture to that of a diseased mitral valve and holds consistent mechanical properties to those of the real tissue.

Calcium phosphate cement reinforced with poly (vinyl alcohol) fibers: An experimental and numerical failure analysis,Paknahad A.; Goudarzi M.; Kucko N.W.; Leeuwenburgh S.C.G.; Sluys L.J.,2021,Acta Biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2020.10.014,"Calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) have been widely used during the past decades as biocompatible bone substitution in maxillofacial, oral and orthopedic surgery. CPCs are injectable and are chemically resemblant to the mineral phase of native bone. Nevertheless, their low fracture toughness and high brittleness reduce their clinical applicability to weakly loaded bones. Reinforcement of CPC matrix with polymeric fibers can overcome these mechanical drawbacks and significantly enhance their toughness and strength. Such fiber-reinforced calcium phosphate cements (FRCPCs) have the potential to act as advanced bone substitute in load-bearing anatomical sites. This work achieves integrated experimental and numerical characterization of the mechanical properties of FRCPCs under bending and tensile loading. To this end, a 3-D numerical gradient enhanced damage model combined with a dimensionally-reduced fiber model are employed to develop a computational model for material characterization and to simulate the failure process of fiber-reinforced CPC matrix based on experimental data. In addition, an advanced interfacial constitutive law, derived from micromechanical pull-out tests, is used to represent the interaction between the polymeric fiber and CPC matrix. The presented computational model is successfully validated with the experimental results and offers a firm basis for further investigations on the development of numerical and experimental analysis of fiber-reinforced bone cements. © 2020 The Authors.

Computational and experimental fatigue analysis of contoured spinal rods,Piovesan A.; Berti F.; Villa T.; Pennati G.; La Barbera L.,2019,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.4042767,"Posterior fixation with contoured rods is an established methodology for the treatment of spinal deformities. Both uniform industrial preforming and intraoperative contouring introduce tensile and compressive plastic deformations, respectively, at the concave and at the convex sides of the rod. The purpose of this study is to develop a validated numerical framework capable of predicting how the fatigue behavior of contoured spinal rods is affected by residual stresses when loaded in lordotic and kyphotic configurations. Established finite element models (FEM) describing static contouring were implemented as a preliminary simulation step and were followed by subsequent cyclical loading steps. The equivalent Sines stress distribution predicted in each configuration was compared to that in straight rods (SR) and related to the corresponding experimental number of cycles to failure. In the straight configuration, the maximum equivalent stress (441 MPa) exceeds the limit curve, as confirmed by experimental rod breakage after around 1.9 × 10^5 loading cycles. The stresses further increased in the lordotic configuration, where failure was reached within 2.4 × 10^4 cycles. The maximum equivalent stress was below the limit curve for the kyphotic configuration (640 MPa), for which a run-out of 10^6 cycles was reached. Microscopy inspection confirmed agreement between numerical predictions and experimental fatigue crack location. The contouring technique (uniform contouring (UC) or French bender (FB)) was not related to any statistically significant difference. Our study demonstrates the key role of residual stresses in altering the mean stress component, superposing to the tensile cyclic load, potentially explaining the higher failure rate of lordotic rods compared to kyphotic ones. © 2019 by ASME.",FALSE,
Modelling and structural analysis of skull/cranial implant: Beyond mid-line deformities,Bogu V.P.; Ravi Kumar Y.; Khanara A.K.,2017,Acta of Bioengineering and Biomechanics,10.5277/ABB-00547-2016-04,"Purpose: This computational study explores modelling and finite element study of the implant under Intracranial pressure (ICP) conditions with normal ICP range (7 mm Hg to 15 mm Hg) or increased ICP (>I5 mm Hg). The implant fixation points allow implant behaviour with respect to intracranial pressure conditions. However, increased fixation points lead to variation in deformation and equivalent stress. Finite element analysis is providing a valuable insight to know the deformation and equivalent stress. Methods: The patient CT data (Computed Tomography) is processed in Mimics software to get the mesh model. The implant is modelled by using modified reverse engineering technique with the help of Rhinoceros software. This modelling method is applicable for all types of defects including those beyond the middle line and multiple ones. It is designed with eight fixation points and ten fixation points to fix an implant. Consequently, the mechanical deformation and equivalent stress (von Mises) are calculated in ANSYS 15 software with distinctive material properties such as Titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK). Results: The deformation and equivalent stress results are obtained through ANSYS 15 software. It is observed that Ti6Al4V material shows low deformation and PEEK material shows less equivalent stress. Among all materials PEEK shows noticeably good result. Conclusions: Hence, a concept was established and more clinically relevant results can be expected with implementation of realistic 3D printed model in the future.

Effect of elastomer characteristics on fiber optic force sensing performance in biomedical robotics applications,Park K.; Kim C.; Kulkarni A.; Shin D.; Kim H.-U.; Kim K.; Kim T.,2018,Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology,10.1007/s12206-018-1109-5,"Miniaturized and “smart” sensors are required for research in biology, physiology, and biomechanics, and they have extremely important clinical applications for diagnostics and minimally invasive surgery. Fiber optic sensors have been proven to provide advantages compared to conventional sensors and high potential for biomechanical and biomedical applications. They are small, easy to operate, minimally invasive with low risk, more accurate, and inexpensive. This paper reports the design and modeling of a fiber optic force sensor that is capable of measuring compliance for a contact force of up to 1 N. The main objective of this study is to design and model a fiber optic sensor capable of measuring the total force applied on an object. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer film with a thickness of 1.2 mm is placed between an optical fiber tip and an object, and it is used for measuring the force applied on a rigid element. The compliance of the fiber optic force sensor is measured by recording the response of PDMS elastomer films under different load conditions. We use finite element modeling results as a basis for comparing experimental data.

A phenomenological contact model: Understanding the graft-tunnel interaction in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery,Salehghaffari S.; Dhaher Y.Y.,2015,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.04.034,"In this paper, we sought to expand the fidelity of a validated model of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) procedure by incorporating a stick-slip contact model with linear pressure-overclosure relationship at the interface. The suggested model is characterized by three unknown parameters, friction coefficient, shear stress softening and contact stiffness. In the absence of any isolated experiments exploring the graft-tunnel interactions during an aggregate joint load, the calibration data used in this study are derived from a reported biomechanical study. A Bayesian calibration procedure was employed to find the unknown probability distribution function (PDF) of these contact parameters. Initially, the response surface approximations of the predicted graft forces from laxity test simulations was adopted to estimate the likelihood of noisy experimental data reported in the literature. Then, the wide domain of contact parameters was sampled sequentially based on the Marcov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with acceptance-rejection criteria to search for population of samples in significantly narrower domain of unknown parameters that are associated with the highest occurrence likelihood of noisy experimental data. Our simulations with calibrated contact parameters indicate that pre-tensioning applied at 30° of flexion leads to larger graft force after the joint is fully extended compared to the graft force when the same pre-tensioning force is applied at full extension. Moreover, regardless of the pre-tensioning force, the graft-tunnel contact pressure is larger when the fixation of the graft is performed at full extension, increasing with the pre-tensioning force. © 2015.",FALSE,

Recent development of a computer-assisted planning and execution (CAPE) system for Le Fort-based FJTT in a pre-clinical swine model offers preoperative planning, and intraoperative navigation. This paper addresses the translation of the CAPE system to human anatomy and presents accuracy results. Methods: Single-jaw, Le Fort-based FJTTs were performed on plastic models, one swine and one human, and on a human cadaver. Preoperative planning defined the goal placement of the donor’s Le Fort-based FJTT segment on the recipient. Patient-specific navigated cutting guides helped achieve planned osteotomies. Intraoperative cutting guide and donor fragment placement were compared with postoperative computed tomography (CT) data and the preoperative plan. Results: Intraoperative measurement error with respect to postoperative CT was less than 1.25 mm for both mock transplants and 3.59 mm for the human cadaver scenario. Donor fragment placement (as compared to the planned position) was less accurate for the human model test case (2.91 mm) compared with the swine test (2.25 mm) and human cadaver (2.26 mm). Conclusion: The results indicate the viability of the CAPE system for assisting with Le Fort-based FJTT and demonstrate the potential in human surgery.

A computational tool for preoperative breast augmentation planning in aesthetic plastic surgery,Georgii J.; Eder M.; Burger K.; Klotz S.; Ferstl F.; Kovacs L.; Westermann R.,2014,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2013.2285308,"Breast augmentation was the most commonly performed cosmetic surgery procedure in 2011 in the United States. Although aesthetically pleasing surgical results can only be achieved if the correct breast implant is selected from a large variety of different prosthesis sizes and shapes available on the market, surgeons still rely on visual assessment and other subjective approaches for operative planning because of lacking objective evaluation tools. In this paper, we present the development of a software prototype for augmentation mammaplasty simulation solely based on 3-D surface scans, from which patient-specific finite-element models are generated in a semiautomatic process. The finite-element model is used to preoperatively simulate the expected breast shapes using physical soft-tissue mechanics. Our approach uses a novel mechanism based on so-called displacement templates, which, for a specific implant shape and position, describe the respective internal body forces. Due to a highly efficient numerical solver we can provide immediate visual feedback of the simulation results, and thus, the software prototype can be integrated smoothly into the medical workflow.

A new framework for characterization of poroelastic materials using indentation,Esteki M.H.; Alemrajabi A.A.; Hall C.M.; Sheridan G.K.; Azadi M.; Moeendarbary E.,2020,Acta Biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2019.11.010,"To characterize a poroelastic material, typically an indenter is pressed onto the surface of the material with a ramp of a finite approach velocity followed by a hold where the indenter displacement is kept constant. This leads to deformation of the porous matrix, pressurization of the interstitial fluid and relaxation due to redistribution of fluid through the pores. In most studies the poroelastic properties, including elastic modulus, Poisson ratio and poroelastic diffusion coefficient, are extracted by assuming an instantaneous step indentation. However, exerting step like indentation is not experimentally possible and usually a ramp indentation with a finite approach velocity is applied. Moreover, the poroelastic relaxation time highly depends on the approach velocity in addition to the poroelastic diffusion coefficient and the contact area. Here, we extensively studied the effect of indentation velocity using finite element simulations which has enabled the formulation of a new framework based on a master curve that incorporates the finite rise time. To verify our novel framework, the poroelastic properties of two types of hydrogels were extracted experimentally using indentation tests at both macro and micro scales. Our new framework that is based on consideration of finite approach velocity is experimentally easy to implement and provides a more accurate estimation of poroelastic properties.",FALSE,
Virtual downsizing for decision support in mitral valve repair,Neugebauer M.; Tautz L.; Hüllebrand M.; Sündermann S.; Degener F.; Goubergrits L.; Kühne T.; Falk V.; Hennemuth A.,2019,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-018-1868-6,"Purpose: Various options are available for the treatment of mitral valve insufficiency, including reconstructive approaches such as annulus correction through ring implants. The correct choice of general therapy and implant is relevant for an optimal outcome. Additional to guidelines, decision support systems (DSS) can provide decision aid by means of virtual intervention planning and predictive simulations. Our approach on virtual downsizing is one of the virtual intervention tools that are part of the DSS workflow. It allows for emulating a ring implantation based on patient-specific lumen geometry and vendor-specific implants. Methods: Our approach is fully automatic and relies on a lumen mask and an annulus contour as inputs. Both are acquired from previous DSS workflow steps. A virtual surface- and contour-based model of a vendor-specific ring design (26–40 mm) is generated. For each case, the ring geometry is positioned with respect to the original, patient-specific annulus and additional anatomical landmarks. The lumen mesh is parameterized to allow for a vertex-based deformation with respect to the user-defined annulus. Derived from post-interventional observations, specific deformation schemes are applied to atrium and ventricle and the lumen mesh is altered with respect to the ring location. Results: For quantitative evaluation, the surface distance between the deformed lumen mesh and segmented post-operative echo lumen close to the annulus was computed for 11 datasets. The results indicate a good agreement. An arbitrary subset of six datasets was used for a qualitative evaluation of the complete lumen. Two domain experts compared the deformed lumen mesh with post-interventional echo images. All deformations were deemed plausible. Conclusion: Our approach on virtual downsizing allows for an automatic creation of plausible lumen deformations. As it takes only a few seconds to generate results, it can be added to a virtual intervention toolset without unnecessarily increasing the pipeline complexity. © 2018, CARS.",FALSE,
Skull reconstruction after resection of bone tumors in a single surgical time by the association of the techniques of rapid prototyping and surgical navigation,Anchieta M.V.M.; Salles F.A.; Cassaro B.D.; Quaresma M.M.; Santos B.F.O.,2016,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-016-1415-2,"Purpose: Presentation of a new cranioplasty technique employing a combination of two technologies: rapid prototyping and surgical navigation. This technique allows the reconstruction of the skull cap after the resection of a bone tumor in a single surgical time. Methods: The neurosurgeon plans the craniotomy previously on the EximiusMed software, compatible with the Eximius Surgical Navigator, both from the company Artis Tecnologia (Brazil). The navigator imports the planning and guides the surgeon during the craniotomy. The simulation of the bone fault allows the virtual reconstruction of the skull cap and the production of a personalized modelling mold using the Magics—Materialise (Belgium)—software. The mold and a replica of the bone fault are made by rapid prototyping by the company Artis Tecnologia (Brazil) and shipped under sterile conditions to the surgical center. The PMMA prosthesis is produced during the surgical act with the help of a hand press. Results: The total time necessary for the planning and production of the modelling mold is four days. The precision of the mold is submillimetric and accurately reproduces the virtual reconstruction of the prosthesis. The production of the prosthesis during surgery takes until twenty minutes depending on the type of PMMA used. The modelling mold avoids contraction and dissipates the heat generated by the material’s exothermic reaction in the polymerization phase. The craniectomy is performed with precision over the drawing made with the help of the Eximius Surgical Navigator, according to the planned measurements. The replica of the bone fault serves to evaluate the adaptation of the prosthesis as a support for the perforations and the placement of screws and fixation plates, as per the surgeon’s discretion.

A novel RBF-based predictive tool for facial distraction surgery in growing children with syndromic craniosynostosis,Angullia F.; Fright W.R.; Richards R.; Schievano S.; Linney A.D.; Dunaway D.J.,2020,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-019-02063-4,"Purpose: Predicting changes in face shape from corrective surgery is challenging in growing children with syndromic craniosynostosis. A prediction tool mimicking composite bone and skin movement during facial distraction would be useful for surgical audit and planning. To model surgery, we used a radial basis function (RBF) that is smooth and continuous throughout space whilst corresponding to measured distraction at landmarks. Our aim is to showcase the pipeline for a novel landmark-based, RBF-driven simulation for facial distraction surgery in children. Methods: An individual’s dataset comprised of manually placed skin and bone landmarks on operated and unoperated regions. Surgical warps were produced for ‘older’ monobloc, ‘older’ bipartition and ‘younger’ bipartition groups by applying a weighted least-squares RBF fitted to the average landmarks and change vectors. A ‘normalisation’ warp, from fitting an RBF to craniometric landmark differences from the average, was applied to each dataset before the surgical warp. The normalisation was finally reversed to obtain the individual prediction. Predictions were compared to actual post-operative outcomes. Results: The averaged change vectors for all groups showed skin and bone movements characteristic of the operations. Normalisation for shape–size removed individual asymmetry, size and proportion differences but retained typical pre-operative shape features. The surgical warps removed the average syndromic features. Reversing the normalisation reintroduced the individual’s variation into the prediction. The mid-facial regions were well predicted for all groups. Forehead and brow regions were less well predicted. Conclusions: Our novel, landmark-based, weighted RBF can predict the outcome for facial distraction in younger and older children with a variety of head and face shapes. It can replicate the surgical reality of composite bone and skin movement jointly in one model. The potential applications include audit of existing patient outcomes, and predicting outcome for new patients to aid surgical planning. © 2019, The Author(s).",FALSE,
Comparison of different constitutive models to characterize the viscoelastic properties of human abdominal adipose tissue.

One of the most important surgeries, for its incidence, is the breast reconstruction surgery that follows a mastectomy. In this case, achieving a deformed shape similar to the healthy breast is crucial. The reconstruction is most commonly made using autologous tissue, taken from the patient's abdomen. The amount of autologous tissue and its mechanical properties have a strong influence on the shape of the reconstructed breast. In this work, the viscoelastic mechanical properties of the human adipose tissue have been studied. Uniaxial compression stress relaxation tests were performed in adipose tissue specimens extracted from the human abdomen. Two different viscoelastic models were used to fit to the experimental tests: a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model and an internal variables viscoelastic (IVV) model; each one with four different hyperelastic strain energy density functions to characterise the elastic response: a 5-terms polynomial function, a first order Ogden function, an isotropic Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel function and a combination of a neoHookean and an exponential function. The IVV model with the Ogden function was the best combination to fit the experimental tests. The viscoelastic properties are not important in the simulation of the static deformed shape of the breast, but they are needed in a relaxation test performed under finite strain rate, particularly, to derive the long-term behaviour (as time tends to infinity), needed to estimate the static deformed shape of the breast. The so obtained stiffness was compared with previous results given in the literature for adipose tissue of different regions, which exhibited a wide dispersion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,
Conceptual design and implantation of an external fixator with improved mobility for knee rehabilitation,Gatti G.,2017,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1080/10255842.2017.1307342,"A hinged external fixator is used to allow early knee rehabilitation in case of injury or trauma, as an alternative approach to immobilization. It is mainly adopted for the treatment of dislocations, which involve tearing of the ligaments, and it basically consists of two links connected to each other by a revolute joint. Each link is fixed to the femur and tibia via pin fixation, and the revolute joint is approximately aligned to the knee flexion-extension (FE) axis. The advantage in its implantation is to protect ligament reconstruction, while allowing for an aggressive rehabilitation. Traditional fixators only accommodate the functional flexion movement in a limited range, i.e. where the anatomical movement is closer to a planar circular trajectory. This paper presents the conceptual design and implantation procedure of a double-axis fixator, which accommodates both FE and longitudinal internal-external rotation. The procedure is based on accurate knee kinematics measurements and on computer-aided multibody simulations to assist clinicians in the implantation. An experimental test is presented using an artificial knee, and guidelines are given for in vitro studies.

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in multiple databases to identify studies that applied ML techniques to predict surgical outcomes. Studies were screened, and data were extracted on ML methods, surgical specialties, outcomes predicted, and performance metrics.  Results: A total of 45 studies met inclusion criteria, encompassing various surgical specialties including general surgery, orthopedics, and neurosurgery. ML models demonstrated promising predictive performance for outcomes such as postoperative complications, mortality, and length of stay. Commonly used algorithms included random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. However, heterogeneity in study design, outcome definitions, and ML methodologies was noted.

"Multi-view stereo analysis reveals anisotropy of prestrain, deformation, and growth in living skin",Buganza Tepole A.; Gart M.; Purnell C.A.; Gosain A.K.; Kuhl E.,2015,Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology,10.1007/s10237-015-0650-8,"Skin expansion delivers newly grown skin that maintains histological and mechanical features of the original tissue. Although it is the gold standard for cutaneous defect correction today, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we present a novel technique to quantify anisotropic prestrain, deformation, and growth in a porcine skin expansion model. Building on our recently proposed method, we combine two novel technologies, multi-view stereo and isogeometric analysis, to characterize skin kinematics: Upon explantation, a unit square retracts ex vivo to a square of average dimensions of 0.83 × 0.83. Upon expansion, the unit square deforms in vivo into a rectangle of average dimensions of 1.40 × 1.34. Deformations are larger parallel than perpendicular to the dorsal midline suggesting that skin responds anisotropically with smaller deformations along the skin tension lines. Upon expansion, the patch grows in vivo by 1.62 × 1.40 with respect to the explanted, unexpanded state. Growth is larger parallel than perpendicular to the midline, suggesting that elevated stretch activates mechanotransduction pathways to stimulate tissue growth. The proposed method provides a powerful tool to characterize the kinematics of living skin. Our results shed light on the mechanobiology of skin and help us to better understand and optimize clinically relevant procedures in plastic and reconstructive surgery. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",FALSE,

Linear Elastic Properties of the Facial Soft Tissues Using an Aspiration Device: Towards Patient Specific Characterization,Luboz V.; Promayon E.; Payan Y.,2014,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10439-014-1098-1,"Biomechanical modeling of the facial soft tissue behavior is needed in aesthetic or maxillo-facial surgeries where the simulation of the bone displacements cannot accurately predict the visible outcome on the patient’s face. Because these tissues have different nature and elastic properties across the face, depending on their thickness, and their content in fat or muscle, individualizing their mechanical parameters could increase the simulation accuracy. Using a specifically designed aspiration device, the facial soft tissues deformation is measured at four different locations (cheek, cheekbone, forehead, and lower lip) on 16 young subjects. The stiffness is estimated from the deformations generated by a set of negative pressures using an inverse analysis based on a Neo Hookean model. The initial Young’s modulus of the cheek, cheekbone, forehead, and lower lip are respectively estimated to be 31.0 kPa ± 4.6, 34.9 kPa ± 6.6, 17.3 kPa ± 4.1, and 33.7 kPa ± 7.3. Significant intra-subject differences in tissue stiffness are highlighted by these estimations. They also show important inter-subject variability for some locations even when mean stiffness values show no statistical difference. This study stresses the importance of using a measurement device capable of evaluating the patient specific tissue stiffness during an intervention. © 2014, Biomedical Engineering Society.",FALSE,
PlasticGAN: Holistic generative adversarial network on face plastic and aesthetic surgery,"Chandaliya, Praveen Kumar and Nain, Neeta",2022,Multimedia Tools and Applications,Springer,"Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. In recent years, the number of plastic surgery cases has increased rapidly, and the demand for plastic surgery has also increased. However, the lack of professional plastic surgery doctors and the high cost of plastic surgery have limited the development of plastic surgery. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a holistic generative adversarial network (PlasticGAN) for face plastic and aesthetic surgery. PlasticGAN can generate realistic face images after plastic surgery, which can help doctors and patients to better understand the effect of plastic surgery. Specifically, PlasticGAN consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator is designed to generate face images after plastic surgery, and the discriminator is designed to distinguish between real and generated images. Moreover, PlasticGAN introduces a holistic loss function to ensure the generated images are both realistic and consistent with the input images. Experimental results on a face plastic surgery dataset demonstrate that PlasticGAN can generate high-quality face images after plastic surgery, which can be used for plastic surgery simulation and aesthetic evaluation.",FALSE,
"An efficient modelling-simulation-analysis workflow to investigate stump-socket interaction using patient-specific, three-dimensional, continuum-mechanical, finite element residual limb models",Ramasamy E.; Avci O.; Dorow B.; Chong S.-Y.; Gizzi L.; Steidle G.; Schick F.; Röhrle O.,2018,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2018.00126,"The lack of an efficient modelling-simulation-analysis workflow for creating and utilising detailed subject-specific computational models is one of the key reasons why simulation-based approaches for analysing socket-stump interaction have not yet been successfully established. Herein, we propose a novel and efficient modelling-simulation-analysis workflow that uses commercial software for generating a detailed subject-specific, three-dimensional finite element model of an entire residual limb from Diffusion Tensor MRI images in < 20 min. Moreover, to complete the modelling-simulation-analysis workflow, the generated subject-specific residual limb model is used within an implicit dynamic FE simulation of bipedal stance to predict the potential sites of deep tissue injury. For this purpose, a nonlinear hyperelastic, transversely isotropic skeletal muscle constitutive law containing a deep tissue injury model was implemented in LS-DYNA. To demonstrate the feasibility of the entire modelling-simulation-analysis workflow and the fact that detailed, anatomically realistic, multi-muscle models are superior to state-of-the-art, fused-muscle models, an implicit dynamic FE analysis of 2-h bipedal stance is carried out. By analysing the potential volume of damaged muscle tissue after donning an optimally-fitted and a misfitted socket, i.e., a socket whose volume was isotropically shrunk by 10%, we were able to highlight the differences between the detailed individual- and fused-muscle models. The results of the bipedal stance simulation showed that peak stresses in the fused-muscle model were four times lower when compared to the multi-muscle model. The peak interface stress in the individual-muscle model, at the end of bipedal stance analysis, was 2.63 times lower than that in the deep tissues of the stump. At the end of the bipedal stance analysis using the misfitted socket, the fused-muscle model predicted that 7.65% of the residual limb volume was injured, while the detailed-model predicted 16.03%. The proposed approach is not only limited to modelling residual limbs but also has applications in predicting the impact of plastic surgery, for detailed forward-dynamics simulations of normal musculoskeletal systems. © 2018 Ramasamy, Avci, Dorow, Chong, Gizzi, Steidle, Schick and Röhrle.",FALSE,
Biomimetic hydrogel for rapid and scar-free healing of skin wounds inspired by the healing process of oral mucosa,Kong X.; Fu J.; Shao K.; Wang L.; Lan X.; Shi J.,2019,Acta Biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2019.10.011,"Inspired by the wound healing characteristics of the oral mucosa, a biomimetic hydrogel was prepared to realize the rapid and scar-free healing of skin wounds.

On the base of our findings, a hydrogel loaded with several functional compounds was prepared to achieve a comprehensive simulation of the oral mucosal trauma microenvironment for skin wound healing. After 7 days treatment, the skin wound area of the treated group was only about 20% of that of the untreated group, and the proportion of collagen type III and type I in the treated group was much higher than that of the untreated group, suggesting lighter scar hyperplasia.

Characteristic evaluation of a magnetic-actuated microrobot in pipe with screw jet motion,Wang Z.; Guo S.; Fu Q.; Guo J.,2019,Microsystem Technologies,10.1007/s00542-018-4000-5,"Research on capsule robotics has been going on for many years, it has extensively applied to the field of endoscopy. The biggest advantage of capsule robots is that they can be swallowed, move in narrow channels, drug delivery and surgery. However, to make itself be able to move in tight spaces, capsule robot must keep its volume small enough which means it also becomes the biggest challenge of the development of capsule robots. This paper carried out a series of simulations and experiments in order to evaluate the characteristic influence of different structures on motion performance for a magnetic-actuated screw jet microrobot (SJM). The whole system consists of three main parts, the power supply section, three-axes Helmholtz coils are to provide a uniform controllable rotating magnetic field; the simulated intestinal part, a transparent plastic pipe; a screw jet microrobot, it consists a radially magnetized O-ring type neodymium magnet and a rotating screw jet structure. Although we carried out this kind of robot over past few months, it still has a lot of uncertainty on the motion performance. The previous papers have proposed this type of magnetic actuated screw jet microrobot and its driving device, principle, etc., since we proved it can run smoothly (extra degree of freedom that enables various advanced functions such as axial position control). The research in paper consists of three evaluation parts, separately evaluated shell, screw, and different liquid environments. The first part evaluated the inlet and outlet size on the shell section, as for the second part, we evaluated the effect on screw with different pitch. The last part of the experiment is about experimenting different kinds of liquid. We also did the simulations and discussed about the motion performance in order to make sure that our results is realizable before the experiments.

Computational modeling for surgical reconstruction of aortic valve by using autologous pericardium,Feng Y.; Cao Y.; Wang W.; Zhang H.; Wei L.; Jia B.; Wang S.,2020,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997605,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of surgical reconstruction of aortic valve using autologous pericardium, and the hemodynamic impact of matching the circumferential direction of the trimmed leaflet to inherent fiber orientation of the pericardium during surgery. A patient specific aortic valve model was built based on CTA data. The reconstructive surgery was carried out on the model following normal operating procedures. FSI simulation was performed to analyze the hemodynamic characteristics among the diseased model, normal model and three operative models with different misaligned angles between the circumferential direction of the substitute and inherent fiber orientation. The differences of EOA, velocity distribution, stress and strain on leaflets, and the valve deformation between the five models were compared and analyzed. The results showed that reconstructive surgery helps enlarge EOA, reduce abnormity of leaflet motion and blood ejection compared to diseased model. There was no significant difference between operative models with different misaligned angles in terms of leaflet motion and flow pattern, but as the misaligned angle increased, greater strain and deformation were observed on leaflets during the diastolic period. The present study demonstrated the instant clinical effectiveness of the reconstructive surgery of aortic valve by the improvement of EOA and flow pattern, and suggested that during the operation it may be unnecessary to match the circumferential direction of the substitute to inherent fiber orientation of the pericardium since the hemodynamic characteristics were insensitive to the fiber alignment, but the strain and deformation increment on the substitutes during diastolic period still raised concern about their durability. © 2013 IEEE.",FALSE,
Mechanical properties and in vivo performance of load-bearing fiber-reinforced composite intramedullary nails with improved torsional strength,Moritz N.; Strandberg N.; Zhao D.S.; Mattila R.; Paracchini L.; Vallittu P.K.; Aro H.T.,2014,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.08.020,"Fiber-reinforced composites (FRC) could be feasible materials for fracture fixation devices if the mechanical properties of the composites are congruent with the local structural properties of bone. In a recently developed FRC implant, bisphenol A dimethacrylate (BisGMA) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) resin was reinforced with unidirectional E-glass fibers. The addition of a braided glass fiber sleeving to the unidirectional fibers increased the torsional strength (99.5 MPa) of the FRC implants at the expense of the flexural strength (602.0 MPa). The flexural modulus was 15.3 GPa. Two types of FRC intramedullary nails were prepared; first type was FRC as such, second type was FRC with a surface layer of bioactive glass (BG) granules. Experimental oblong subtrochanteric defect was created in 14 rabbits. The defect, which reduced the torsional strength of the bones by 66%, was fixed with an FRC intramedullary nail of either type. The contralateral intact femur served as the control. This model simulated surgical stabilization of bone metastasis. After 12 weeks of follow-up, the femurs were harvested and analyzed by torsional testing, micro-CT and hard tissue histology. Healed undisplaced peri-implant fractures were noticed in half of the animals irrespective of the type of FRC implant. Torsional testing showed no significant differences between the implantation groups. The torsional strength of the bones stabilized by either type of FRC implant was 83% of that of the contralateral femurs. In histological analysis, no implant debris and no adverse tissue reactions were observed. While the mechanical properties of the modified FRCs were suboptimal, the FRC intramedullary nails supported the femurs without structural failure, even in the cases of peri-implant fractures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",FALSE,
Fluid dynamic assessment of tracheal flow in infants with congenital tracheal stenosis before and after surgery,Takeishi N.; Miki T.; Otani T.; Ii S.; Morita K.; Wada S.,2019,Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing,10.1007/s11517-018-1928-7,"Tracheal flow in infants with congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) was numerically investigated using subject-specific airway models before and after reconstructive surgery. We quantified tracheal flow based on airway resistance during inhalation, and compared it between controls and patients before and after surgery. The airway resistance in each subject was assessed using geometrical parameters of the trachea: the minimum cross-sectional area Amin, the minimum cross-sectional area normalized by the standard deviation of the cross-sectional area Amin/σA, the area ratio of the minimum and maximum cross-sectional area Amin/Amax, and ratio of the normalized standard deviation of cross-sectional area to the mean cross-sectional area σA/Amean. Our numerical results demonstrated that such geometrical parameters could be used to assess the severity of CTS. Since subjects can be more clearly categorized as controls and most preoperative patients in terms of the airway resistance, a simulation using subject-specific airway models can lead us to a precise understanding of tracheal flow, and also provide knowledge about therapeutic decision. Our numerical results also demonstrated that significant surgical expansion of cross-sectional area did not help recover tracheal flow because of expansion loss. These results will be helpful not only when making therapeutic decisions about surgery but also when assessing quality of life in postoperative patients.

Novel technologies emerged to overcome LESS’ procedural and ergonomic difficulties of “tunnel vision” and “instrument clashing.” Surgeon kinematics, self-reported workload and upper body discomfort were used to compare straight, bent and two articulating instruments while performing two basic surgical tasks in a LESS simulator. All instruments resulted in bilateral elevation and rotation of the shoulders, excessive forearm motion and flexion and ulnar deviation of wrists. Surgeons’ adopted non-neutral upper extremity postures and performed excessive joint excursions to compensate for reduced freedom of movement at the single insertion site and to operate the instrument mechanisms.

The drilling parameters studied here include the feed rate and rotation speed of the drill. The bone temperature distribution was analyzed through experiments and numerical simulations of the drilling process. In this study, a three dimensional (3D) elasto-plastic dynamic finite element model (DFEM) was proposed to investigate the effects of drilling parameters on the bone temperature rise. In addition, the FE model is validated with drilling experiments on artificial human bones and porcine alveolar bones. The results indicate that 3D DFEM can effectively simulate the bone temperature rise during the drilling process. During the drilling process with pilot drills or twist drills, the maximum bone temperature occurred in the region of the cancellous bones close to the cortical bones. The feed rate was one of the important factors affecting the time when the maximum bone temperature occurred. Our results also demonstrate that the elevation of bone temperature was reduced as the feed rate increased and the drill speed decreased, which also effectively reduced the risk region of osteonecrosis.

Experimental validation of predicted application accuracies for computer-assisted (CAS) intraoperative navigation with paired-point registration,Perwög M.; Bardosi Z.; Freysinger W.,2018,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-017-1653-y,"Purpose: The target registration error (TRE) is a crucial parameter to estimate the potential usefulness of computer-assisted navigation intraoperatively. Both image-to-patient registration on base of rigid-body registration and TRE prediction methods are available for spatially isotropic and anisotropic data. This study presents a thorough validation of data obtained in an experimental operating room setting with CT images. Methods: Optical tracking was used to register a plastic skull, an anatomic specimen, and a volunteer to their respective CT images. Plastic skull and anatomic specimen had implanted bone fiducials for registration; the volunteer was registered with anatomic landmarks. Fiducial localization error, fiducial registration error, and total target error (TTE) were measured; the TTE was compared to isotropic and anisotropic error prediction models. Numerical simulations of the experiment were done additionally. Results: The user localization error and the TTE were measured and calculated using predictions, both leading to results as expected for anatomic landmarks and screws used as fiducials. TRE/TTE is submillimetric for the plastic skull and the anatomic specimen. In the experimental data a medium correlation was found between TRE and target localization error (TLE). Most of the predictions of the application accuracy (TRE) fall in the 68% confidence interval of the measured TTE. For the numerically simulated data, a prediction of TTE was not possible; TRE and TTE show a negligible correlation. Conclusion: Experimental application accuracy of computer-assisted navigation could be predicted satisfactorily with adequate models in an experimental setup with paired-point registration of CT images to a patient.

Improved non-local self-similarity measures for effective speckle noise reduction in ultrasound images,Mei F.; Zhang D.; Yang Y.,2020,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105670,"Background and objective: In the observed medical ultrasound image, there is always some speckle noise which suppress the details of images and impairs the value of ultrasonography in diagnosis. This work present a novel despeckling method which effectively exploit non-local self-similarity for restoration of corrupted ultrasound images. The proposed approach consist of three stages. First, an improved optimized Bayesian non-local means (OBNLM) filter in which pixel patch is represented by a new vector form is used to get an preliminary estimation of noise-free image. Then, a new index called redundancy index of each pixel patch is calculated for determining which areas in image have low redundancy. Finally, another new vector form is used to represent pixel patch in areas with low redundancy obtained in second stage to recalculate filtered output, and the recalculated output is superimposed on preliminary estimation to generate final result of proposed method. Methods: The performance of proposed approach is evaluated on simulated and real ultrasound images. The experiments conducted on various test image illustrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the various classic denoising algorithms included block matching 3-D (BM3D) and optimized Bayesian non-local means filter. Results: The objective evaluations and subjective visual inspection of denoised simulated and real ultrasound images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance than previously developed methods for speckle noise suppression. Conclusions: The combined use of two new representations improve denoising and edge preserving capability of proposed filter apparently.

The patient presented with symptoms of rigors and dyspnea occurring immediately after infusion of Wallcur Practi-0.9% saline. Initial laboratory evidence was consistent with severe septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction. His initial lactic acid level was 9 mmol/L (reference range = 0.5-2.2), and he had evidence of acute kidney injury and markers of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

This patient represents the first described case of severe septic shock associated with the infusion of a Wallcur simulation product. Intravenous inoculation of a nonsterile fluid is rare and exposes the patient to unusual environmental organisms, toxins, or unsafe fluid characteristics such as tonicity. During course of treatment, we identified the possible culprit to be a multidrug-resistant isolate of Empedobacter brevis.

Control of the micromovements of a composite-material nail design: A finite element analysis,Ben-Or M.; Shavit R.; Ben-Tov T.; Salai M.; Steinberg E.L.,2016,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.09.011,"Background: Intramedullary nail fixation is the most accepted modality for stabilizing long bone midshaft fractures. The commercially used nails are fabricated from Stainless Steel or Titanium. Composite-materials (CM) mainly carbon-fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) have been gaining more interest and popularity due to their properties, such as modulus of elasticity close to that of bone, increased fatigue strength, and radio-opacity to irradiation that permits a better visualization of the healing process. The use of CFRP instead of metals allows better control of different directional movements along a fracture site. The purpose of this analysis was to design a CM intramedullary nail to enable micromovements as depicted on a finite element analysis method. Methods: We designed a three-dimentional femoral nail model. Three CFRP with different laminates arrangements, were included in the analysis. The finite element analysis involved applying vertical and horizontal loads on each of the designed and tested nails. Results: The nails permitted a transverse micromovement of 0.75. mm for the 45° lay-up and 1.5. mm for the 90° lay-up for the CM, 1.38. mm for the Titanium and 0.74. mm for the Stainless Steel nails. The recorded axial movements were 0.53. mm for the 45° lay-up, 0.87. mm for the 90° lay-up, 0.46. mm for the unsymmetrical lay-up CM, 0.046 for the Titanium and 0.02 for the Stainless Steel nails. Overall, the simulations showed that nail transverse micromovements can be reduced by using 45° carbon fiber orientations. Similar results were observed with each metal nails. Interpretation: We found that nail micromovements can be controlled by changing the directional stiffness using different lay-up orientations. These results can be useful for predicting nail micromovements under specified loading conditions which are crucial for stimulating callus formation in the early stages of healing. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",FALSE,

A wearable navigation display can improve attentiveness to the surgical field,Stewart J.; Billinghurst M.,2016,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-016-1372-9,"Purpose: Surgical navigation is typically shown on a computer display that is distant from the patient, making it difficult for the surgeon to watch the patient while performing a guided task. We investigate whether a light-weight, untracked, wearable display (such as Google Glass, which has the same size and weight as corrective glasses) can improve attentiveness to the surgical field in a simulated surgical task. Methods: Three displays were tested: a computer monitor; a peripheral display above the eye; and a through-the-lens display in front of the eye. Twelve subjects performed a task to position and orient a tracked tool on a plastic femur. Both wearable displays were tested on the dominant and non-dominant eyes of each subject. Attentiveness during the task was measured by the time taken to respond to randomly illuminated LEDs on the femur. Results: Attentiveness was improved with the wearable displays at the cost of a decrease in accuracy. The through-the-lens display performed better than the peripheral display. The peripheral display performed better when on the dominant eye, while the through-the-lens display performed better when on the non-dominant eye. Conclusions: Attentiveness to the surgical field can be improved with the use of a light-weight, untracked, wearable display. A through-the-lens display performs better than a peripheral display, and both perform better than a computer monitor. Eye dominance should be considered when positioning the display. © 2016, CARS.",FALSE,
3D surgical planning in patients affected by lipodystrophy,Pérez-Carrasco J.A.; Acha B.; Gómez-Cia T.; Lopez-Garcia R.A.; Delgado C.; Serrano C.,2015,Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics,10.1016/j.compmedimag.2014.12.007,"Lipodystrophy is a pathological condition characterized by the focal or general absence of adipose tissue. Surgeons reset the patient's surface contours using injectable materials to recreate a normal physical appearance. However, due to difficulties in preoperative planning and intraoperative assessment, about 15% of the surgical procedures involved are reinterventions to improve volume or symmetry. This increases the need for an available, efficient tool capable of providing the surgeon with a good estimation of the volumes to be injected before the intervention proper begins. This work describes a virtual reality-based application for the surgical planning of facial lipodystrophy correction (FLIC). The tool uses points selected interactively by the surgeon to compute a curve that delimits the surface area to be operated on. It then automatically computes an estimated natural reconstructed surface and the quantity of volume that needs to be implanted during the intervention. Experiments have been carried out in which the filling volumes estimated using FLIC and ZBrush software were compared with the real volumes injected by the surgeon. ICCs higher than 0.97 indicate that there were no significant differences between the respective measurements, thus validating the tool proposed in this paper. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",TRUE,"Focuses on 3D planning, not on automatic outcome prediction."
A cost-effective surgical navigation solution for periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) surgery,Pflugi S.; Liu L.; Ecker T.M.; Schumann S.; Larissa Cullmann J.; Siebenrock K.; Zheng G.,2016,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-015-1267-1,"Purpose: To evaluate a low-cost, inertial sensor-based surgical navigation solution for periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) surgery without the line-of-sight impediment. Methods: Two commercial inertial measurement units (IMU, Xsens Technologies, The Netherlands), are attached to a patient’s pelvis and to the acetabular fragment, respectively. Registration of the patient with a pre-operatively acquired computer model is done by recording the orientation of the patient’s anterior pelvic plane (APP) using one IMU. A custom-designed device is used to record the orientation of the APP in the reference coordinate system of the IMU. After registration, the two sensors are mounted to the patient’s pelvis and acetabular fragment, respectively. Once the initial position is recorded, the orientation is measured and displayed on a computer screen. A patient-specific computer model generated from a pre-operatively acquired computed tomography scan is used to visualize the updated orientation of the acetabular fragment. Results: Experiments with plastic bones (eight hip joints) performed in an operating room comparing a previously developed optical navigation system with our inertial-based navigation system showed no statistically significant difference on the measurement of acetabular component reorientation. In all eight hip joints the mean absolute difference was below four degrees. Conclusion: Using two commercially available inertial measurement units we show that it is possible to accurately measure the orientation (inclination and anteversion) of the acetabular fragment during PAO surgery and therefore to successfully eliminate the line-of-sight impediment that optical navigation systems have. © 2015, CARS.",FALSE,
Development and evaluation of a semi-automatic technique for determining the bilateral symmetry plane of the facial skeleton,Willing R.T.; Roumeliotis G.; Jenkyn T.R.; Yazdani A.,2013,Medical Engineering and Physics,10.1016/j.medengphy.2013.06.006,"During reconstructive surgery of the face, one side may be used as a template for the other, exploiting assumed bilateral facial symmetry.

A new semi-automatic technique for calculating the symmetry plane of the facial skeleton is presented here that uses surface models reconstructed from computed tomography image data in conjunction with principal component analysis and an iterative closest point alignment method. This new technique was found to provide more accurate symmetry planes than traditional methods when applied to a set of 7 human craniofacial skeleton specimens, and showed little vulnerability to missing model data, usually deviating less than 1.5° and 2. mm from the intact model symmetry plane when 30. mm radius voids were present.

First, the desired facial appearance is designed using a 3D sculpturing tool, while the cut regions of the skull are defined based on facial anatomy. Then, the deformation of the face meshes is performed using an improved biomechanical model in which virtual external forces are driven by the displacements corresponding to the differences of node coordinates between the original and specified face meshes, and free nodes and fixed nodes are defined in terms of the contact surfaces between the soft tissues and the bones within the cut regions. Finally, the shape of the contact surfaces is updated following the deformation of the soft tissues. After registering the deformable contact surfaces and the cut surfaces, the final positions of the cut bones are estimated.

Mechanical analysis of eyelid morphology,Zhu L.; Chen X.,2013,Acta Biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2013.04.011,"From a mechanical instability perspective a double eyelid is a double-folded thin film structure on a curved substrate, caused by compression as the film slides on the substrate. The underlying mechanics issues, in particular the requirements for forming a double folded structure, are studied using a modeling/ simulation framework. A minimalist model is employed to explore the wrinkle to fold transition. Refined and enriched models are further developed based on anatomical structures, which demonstrate three critical factors for the formation of double layer folding of the eyelid. First, a crease line in the eyelid is essential where the local bending rigidity is relatively weak. Second, the skin above the crease line should be thin and wide enough. Third, the skin below the crease line should have a relatively large effective stiffness so it can be lifted as a whole when the eyes open. When the eye is opened beyond about 40% of its initial wrinkle wavelength, the double-folded structure emerges. Various types of eyelid morphologies are discussed based on the mechanistic model. The study provides useful insights for surgery, cosmetics, and morphogenesis, as well as microfabrication. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",FALSE,
Accurate and robust reconstruction of a surface model of the proximal femur from sparse-point data and a dense-point distribution model for surgical navigation,Zheng G.; Dong X.; Rajamani K.T.; Zhang X.; Styner M.; Thoranaghatte R.U.; Nolte L.-P.; Gonzalez Ballester M.A.,2007,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2007.895736,"Constructing a 3-D surface model from sparse-point data is a nontrivial task. Here, we report an accurate and robust approach for reconstructing a surface model of the proximal femur from sparse-point data and a dense-point distribution model (DPDM). The problem is formulated as a three-stage optimal estimation process. The first stage, affine registration, is to iteratively estimate a scale and a rigid transformation between the mean surface model of the DPDM and the sparse input points. The estimation results of the first stage are used to establish point correspondences for the second stage, statistical instantiation, which stably instantiates a surface model from the DPDM using a statistical approach. This surface model is then fed to the third stage, kernel-based deformation, which further refines the surface model. Handling outliers is achieved by consistently employing the least trimmed squares (LTS) approach with a roughly estimated outlier rate in all three stages. If an optimal value of the outlier rate is preferred, we propose a hypothesis testing procedure to automatically estimate it. We present here our validations using four experiments, which include 1) leave-one-out experiment, 2) experiment on evaluating the present approach for handling pathology, 3) experiment on evaluating the present approach for handling outliers, and 4) experiment on reconstructing surface models of seven dry cadaver femurs using clinically relevant data without noise and with noise added. Our validation results demonstrate the robust performance of the present approach in handling outliers, pathology, and noise. An average 95-percentile error of 1.7 - 2.3 mm was found when the present approach was used to reconstruct surface models of the cadaver femurs from sparse-point data with noise added.

Experimental and numerical determination of the mechanical response of teeth with reinforced posts,Papadopoulos T.; Papadogiannis D.; Mouzakis D.E.; Giannadakis K.; Papanicolaou G.,2010,Biomedical Materials,10.1088/1748-6041/5/3/035009,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanical behavior of endodontically treated teeth restored with fiber reinforced composite posts versus titanium posts, by both experimental testing and numerical simulation (finite element analysis (FEA)). Forty maxillary central incisors were endodontically treated to a size 45 file and then obturated using gutta-percha points and sealer with the lateral condensation technique. The teeth were divided into four groups of ten teeth each. All the posts were of similar dimensions. The first group was restored using carbon fiber reinforced posts (CB), the second and third groups were restored using glass fiber reinforced posts (DP and FW, respectively), and the fourth group (control group) was restored using conventional titanium posts (PP). Half of the specimens of every group were submitted to hydrothermal cycling (2000 cycles, at 5 °C and 55 °C, respectively). All specimens were loaded until failure at a 45° angle with respect to the longitudinal axis at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm min-1. A two-dimensional finite element model was designed in order to simulate the experimentally obtained results. Mechanical testing revealed that teeth restored with titanium posts exhibited the highest fracture strength. Debonding of the core was the main failure mode observed in glass fiber posts, whereas vertical root fractures were observed in the titanium posts. FEA revealed that the maximum stresses were developed at the interface between the post, dentin and the composite core critical regions in all three cases. Hydrothermal cycling had no significant effect on the fracture behavior of fiber reinforced composite posts. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",FALSE,

This study compared the efficacy to reconstruct a 3-D arrangement of objects that was either presented as a real model, as magnetic resonance images (MRI), or as a VR model. From April 2005 to June 2006 two groups, experienced neurosurgeons and medical students in their fourth year of medical education, studied a three-dimensional arrangement of water-filled plastic objects either as a real model, using a VR workstation, or by examining the MRI images. They were then asked to reconstruct the model as accurately as possible. The reconstructed models were then compared to the respective original models. The most accurate reconstructions were achieved when the participants had memorized the real model. VR visualization produced larger errors, and reconstruction accuracy based on MRI scans was worst. Neurosurgeons did not perform better than students. Our results show that, compared to standard MRI scans, the accuracy of mental representation does benefit from the stereoscopic rendering of the model, which has been built from sequential MRI scans. However, best results were achieved when learning from the original model. Thus, VR is beneficial and at the same time there is room for further improvement when trying to optimize the visual basis for anatomy training and surgery planning, both for expert as well as for novice surgeons. © Virtual Reality Medical Institute.",FALSE,

The clinical outcomes of AVR are strongly dependent on an appropriate choice of both prosthesis size and replacement technique, which are, at present, strictly related to surgeon's experience and skill. Therefore, also this treatment, like most reconstructive procedures in cardiac surgery, remains ""more art than science"" [1].

Traditional methods, such as mean squared error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), have been widely used but often fail to correlate well with perceived visual quality. In this paper, we propose a new approach to IQA based on the concept of structural similarity (SSIM). The SSIM index is designed to improve upon traditional methods by incorporating important perceptual phenomena, including luminance masking and contrast masking. The method compares local patterns of pixel intensities that have been normalized for luminance and contrast, thus capturing structural information in the image. Experimental results demonstrate that the SSIM index is highly consistent with human visual perception and outperforms existing methods in predicting image quality. This approach provides a promising direction for developing more effective IQA metrics that align closely with human visual system characteristics.",FALSE,

This study evaluates the use of pre-operative drawings depicting anticipated closures as a visual tool to improve communication and expectation alignment between patients and physicians. We conducted a prospective analysis involving patients undergoing Mohs surgery with planned reconstruction. Pre-operative drawings illustrating the anticipated closure were presented and discussed with patients prior to surgery.

Background: Recently, the concept of thermal damage time as a reference for pulse duration has become a subject of debate. Methods: Laser-Induced-Temperature-Calculation-In-Tissue (LITCIT) was used for the simulations. Skin was modeled as two homogenous layers of epidermis/dermis and two coaxial cylinders as the hair shaft/ follicle. Opto-thermal coefficients of the components and the radiant parameters of the laser (diode, 810 nm) were defined. Results: At constant fluences and pulse durations, the damage occurred deeper when larger spot sizes were used. At constant pulse duration, high fluences caused significant damage to the hair follicle and epidermis. By using longer pulse durations (≤400 ms) at constant fluences, there was more effective damage to the hair follicle while sparing the adjacent epidermis and dermis. Because of the time-dependent temperature profiles, an increased pulse duration creates a moderate, gradual rise in the target's temperature. Pulse durations >400 ms are accompanied by unwanted dermis damage. Conclusions: Our results show that using very long pulse durations near the tissue damage time (≤400 ms) creates better efficacy in treating unwanted hairs while avoiding unwanted damage. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011.",TRUE,"Focuses on laser hair removal, not on predicting or evaluating surgery results."

The hypothesis proposed was that exacerbated wear would occur following the long-term wear of RBCs irradiated under non-optimized irradiance conditions. Methods: Disc-shaped specimens (12.0 ± 0.1 mm diameter and 2.0 ± 0.1 mm height) of each RBC were prepared at irradiances of 650 ± 14, 530 ± 8, 420 ± 14, 350 ± 8, 270 ± 8, 230 ± 14, 190 ± 8, and 150 ± 8 mW/cm2, respectively. Short-term three-body wear simulation was carried out for 50,000 cycles and long-term was performed up to 500,000 cycles. The wear facets were analyzed using a non-contact optical profilometer. One-, two-, and three-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were made at P = 0.05, guided as necessary by Tukeys correction in multiple partial analyses of the mean total volumetric wear and mean maximum wear depth. Results: For the short-term wear resistance, the two-way ANOVA identified no significant difference in the mean total volumetric wear (P = 0.188) although the mean total wear depth was identified to be significant (P = 0.024). The long-term wear resistance for the mean total volumetric wear identified significant differences for each RBC at varying irradiances with the number of cycles but not for the mean maximum wear depth. Significance: The increased number of ploughing actions of the antagonist on the RBC (long-term) results in increased friction which would be expected to play a major role in the wear process. The significant increase in the mean total volumetric wear, but not the mean maximum wear depth, observed over time which is exacerbated at reduced halogen irradiances emphasizes the arguments of DeLong for the employment of volume for evaluating material loss due to wear following in vitro wear simulation of RBCs. © 2008 Academy of Dental Materials.",TRUE,"Covers dental material durability, not surgery results prediction."

The purpose of this study was to apply and validate a nonlinear finite element model for permanent deformation prediction in cast denture clasps. Such a model can enhance the process of design optimization and contribute to minimizing the possibility of this problem. Methods: Cast clasps made from Ti-6Al-7Nb, Co-Cr and Type IV gold alloys were loaded in three different directions (outside, inside and outside inclined 30°), and the resulting permanent deformation values were recorded. Nonlinear finite element analysis simulations based on the maximum distortion energy criterion for yielding, were conducted for clasp models that were reproduced according to the dimensions of each experimental specimen.

In order to reduce surgeons' burden, we have developed a master-slave robot system which can provide robot-assisted SILS as if it were performing conventional laparoscopic surgery and confirmed the feasibility of our proposed system. Methods The proposed system is composed of an input device (master side), a surgical robot system (slave side), and a control PC. To perform SILS in the same style as regular laparoscopic surgery, input instruments are inserted into multiple incisions, and the tip position and pose of the left-sided (right-sided) robotic instrument on the slave side follow those of the right-sided (left-sided) input instruments on the master side by means of a control command from the PC. To validate the proposed system, we defined four operating conditions and conducted simulation experiments and physical experiments with surgeons under these conditions, then compared the results. Results In the simulation experiments, we found learning effects between trials (P = 0.00013 < 0.05). Our proposed system had no significant difference from a condition simulating classical laparoscopic surgery (P = 0.23 > 0.1), and the task time of our system was significantly shorter than the simulated SILS (P = 0.011 < 0.05). In the physical experiments, our system performed SILS more easily, efficiently, and intuitively than the other operating conditions. Conclusion Our proposed system enabled the surgeons to perform SILS as if they were operating conventionally with laparoscopic techniques. © 2011 CARS.",FALSE,
Three-dimensional reconstruction of cranial defect using active contour model and image registration,Liao Y.-L.; Lu C.-F.; Sun Y.-N.; Wu C.-T.; Lee J.-D.; Lee S.-T.; Wu Y.-T.,2011,Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing,10.1007/s11517-010-0720-0,"In neurosurgery, cranial incisions during craniotomy can be recovered by cranioplasty—a surgical operation using cranial implants to repair skull defects. However, surgeons often encounter difficulties when grafting prefabricated cranial plates into defective areas, since a perfect match to the cranial incision is difficult to achieve. Previous studies using mirroring technique, surface interpolation, or deformed template had limitations in skull reconstruction to match the patient's original appearance. For this study, we utilized low-resolution and high-resolution computed tomography images from the patient to repair skull defects, whilst preserving the original shape. Since the accuracy of skull reconstruction was associated with the partial volume effects in the low-resolution images and the percentage of the skull defect in the high-resolution images, the low-resolution images with intact skull were resampled and thresholded followed by active contour model to suppress partial volume artifacts. The resulting low-resolution images were registered with the high-resolution ones, which exhibited different percentages of cranial defect, to extract the incised cranial part. Finally, mesh smoothing refined the three-dimensional model of the cranial defect. Simulation results indicate that the reconstruction was 93.94% accurate for a 20% skull material removal, and 97.76% accurate for 40% skull material removal. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively creates a customized implant, which can readily be used in cranioplasty. © 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.",FALSE,
The role of computer-aided 3D surgery and stereolithographic modelling for vector orientation in premaxillary and trans-sinusoidal maxillary distraction osteogenesis,Varol A.; Basa S.,2009,International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery,10.1002/rcs.251,"Background: Maxillary distraction osteogenesis is a challenging procedure when it is performed with internal submerged distractors due to obligation of setting accurate distraction vectors. Methods: Five patients with severe maxillary retrognathy were planned with Mimics 10.01 CMF and Simplant 10.01 software. Distraction vectors and rods of distractors were arranged in 3D environment and on STL models. All patients were operated under general anaesthesia and complete Le Fort I downfracture was performed. Results: All distractions were performed according to orientated vectors. All patients achieved stable occlusion and satisfactory aesthetic outcome at the end of the treatment period. Conclusion: Preoperative bending of internal maxillary distractors prevents significant loss of operation time. 3D computer-aided surgical simulation and model surgery provide accurate orientation of distraction vectors for premaxillary and internal trans-sinusoidal maxillary distraction.

Advanced interactive medical visualization on the GPU,Tatarchuk N.; Shopf J.; DeCoro C.,2008,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,10.1016/j.jpdc.2008.06.011,"Interactive visual analysis of a patient's anatomy by means of computer-generated 3D imagery is crucial for diagnosis, pre-operative planning, and surgical training. The task of visualization is no longer limited to producing images at interactive rates, but also includes the guided extraction of significant features to assist the user in the data exploration process. An effective visualization module has to perform a problem-specific abstraction of the dataset, leading to a more compact and hence more efficient visual representation. Moreover, many medical applications, such as surgical training simulators and pre-operative planning for plastic and reconstructive surgery, require the visualization of datasets that are dynamically modified or even generated by a physics-based simulation engine. In this paper we present a set of approaches that allow interactive exploration of medical datasets in real time. Our method combines direct volume rendering via ray-casting with a novel approach for isosurface extraction and re-use directly on graphics processing units (GPU)s in a single framework. The isosurface extraction technique takes advantage of the recently introduced Microsoft(R) DirectX®10 pipeline for dynamic surface extraction in real time using geometry shaders. This surface is constructed in polygonal form and can be directly used post-extraction for collision detection, rendering, and optimization. The resulting polygonal surface can also be analyzed for geometric properties, such as feature area, volume and size deviation, which is crucial for semi-automatic tumor analysis as used, for example, in colonoscopy. Additionally, we have developed a technique for real-time volume data analysis by providing an interactive user interface for designing material properties for organs in the scanned volume. Combining isosurface with direct volume rendering allows visualization of the surface properties as well as the context of tissues surrounding the region and gives better context for navigation. Our application can be used with CT and MRI scan data, or with a variety of other medical and scientific applications. The techniques we present are general and intuitive to implement and can be used for many other interactive environments and effects, separately or together. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Subjective assessment of facial aesthetics after maxillofacial orthognathic surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea,"Islam, Shofiq and Aleem, Fahd and Ormiston, Ian W",2015,British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,Elsevier,"Introduction: Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) surgery is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). However, the aesthetic outcome of this surgery is not well documented. This study aimed to assess subjective facial aesthetic changes following MMA surgery for OSA.  Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted on patients undergoing MMA surgery for OSA. Pre- and postoperative standardized photographs were taken. Subjective facial aesthetics were assessed by patients, surgeons, and laypeople using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Changes in facial aesthetics were compared pre- and postoperatively.  Results: Twenty patients were included. Postoperative assessments showed a significant improvement in facial aesthetics scores by patients, surgeons, and laypeople (p < 0.05). The majority of patients reported satisfaction with their postoperative facial appearance. Surgeons and laypeople also rated postoperative facial aesthetics more favorably.  Conclusion: MMA surgery for OSA results in subjective improvement in facial aesthetics as perceived by patients, surgeons, and laypeople. These findings support the dual benefit of MMA surgery in treating OSA and enhancing facial appearance.",FALSE,

Existing circulatory support systems have proven successful for short-term pediatric assist, but are not completely successful as a bridge-to-transplant or bridge-to-recovery. To address this substantial need for alternative pediatric mechanical assist, we are developing a novel, magnetically levitated, axial flow pediatric ventricular assist device (PVAD) intended for longer-term ventricular support. Three major numerical design and optimization phases have been completed. A prototype was built based on the latest numerical design (PVAD3) and hydraulically tested in a flow loop. The plastic PVAD prototype delivered 0.5-4 lpm, generating pressure rises of 50-115 mm Hg for operating speeds of 6,000-9,000 rpm. The experimental testing data and the numerical predictions correlated well. The error between these sets of data was found to be generally 7.8% with a maximum deviation of 24% at higher flow rates. The axial fluid forces for the numerical simulations ranged from 0.5 to 1 N and deviated from the experimental results by generally 8.5% with a maximum deviation of 12% at higher flow rates.

Does graft construct lengthening at the fixations cause an increase in anterior laxity following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in vivo?,Smith C.K.; Hull M.L.; Howell S.M.,2010,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.4001027,"A millimeter-for-millimeter relation between an increase in length of an anterior cruciate ligament graft construct and an increase in anterior laxity has been demonstrated in multiple in vitro studies. Based on this relation, a 3 mm increase in length of the graft construct following surgery could manifest as a 3 mm increase in anterior laxity in vivo, which is considered clinically unstable. Hence, the two primary objectives were to determine whether the millimeter-for-millimeter relation exists in vivo for slippage-resistant fixation of a soft-tissue graft and, if it does not exist, then to what extent the increase in stiffness caused by biologic healing of the graft to the bone tunnel offsets the potential increase in anterior laxity resulting from lengthening at the sites of fixation. Sixteen subjects were treated with a fresh-frozen, nonirradiated, nonchemically processed tibialis allograft. Tantalum markers were injected into the graft, fixation devices, and bones. On the day of surgery and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months, Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis was used to compute anterior laxity at 150 N of anterior force and the total slippage from both sites of fixation. A simple linear regression was performed to determine whether the millimeter-for-millimeter relation existed and a springs-in-series model of the graft construct was used to determine the extent to which the increase in stiffness caused by biological healing of the graft to the bone tunnel offset the increase in anterior laxity resulting from lengthening at the sites of fixation. There was no correlation between lengthening at the sites of fixation and the increase in anterior laxity at 1 month (R2 = 0.0, slope = 0.2). Also, the increase in stiffness of the graft construct caused by biologic healing of the graft to the bone tunnel offset 0.7 mm of the 1.5 mm potential increase in anterior laxity resulting from lengthening at the sites of fixation. This relatively large offset of nearly 50% occurred because lengthening at the sites of fixation was small. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.",FALSE,
A hyperelastic finite-element model of human skin for interactive real-time surgical simulation,Lapeer R.J.; Gasson P.D.; Karri V.,2011,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2009.2038364,"A finite-element (FE) model of human skin is proposed for future use in an interactive real-time surgical simulation to teach surgeons procedures, such as facial reconstruction using skin-flap repair. For this procedure, skin is cut into flaps that are stretched to cover openings in the face. Thus, the model must recreate the visual, haptic, and force feedback expected by the surgeon. To develop the FE model, a series of in vitro experiments were conducted on samples of human skin, subjected to uniaxial and planar tensile straining. Reduced polynomial hyperelastic (HE) materials were found to fit many of the samples stress-strain data well. Finally, an explicit dynamic FE mesh was developed based on the fitted HE material models. A total Lagrangian formulation with the half-step central difference method was employed to integrate the dynamic equation of motion of the mesh. The mesh was integrated into two versions of a real-time skin simulator: a single-threaded version running on a computers main central processing unit and a multithreaded version running on the computers graphics card. The latter was achieved by exploiting recent advances in programmable graphics technology. © 2011 IEEE.",FALSE,
A finite element model to accurately predict real deformations of the breast,del Palomar A.P.; Calvo B.; Herrero J.; López J.; Doblaré M.,2008,Medical Engineering and Physics,10.1016/j.medengphy.2008.01.005,"Most surgical procedures in breast plastic surgery are either reconstructive procedures following oncologic interventions (tumorectomy, quadrantectomy, mastectomy ...) or aesthetic ones, both augmentation and reduction. With current techniques, the results of such procedures cannot be fully guaranteed. Usually, surgical planning is based on a photographic and anthropometric study of the breast only. Among others, one of the difficulties that the plastic surgeons have is the noticeable change of the breast shape with the position of the patient. Thus, it is more and more necessary to plan a presurgical methodology to help the plastic surgeon and guarantee the patient a successful result of the intervention. In order to establish a reliable simulation method that could predict a patient-specific outcome after breast surgery, this study started trying to correlate spatial features of the breast between lying and standing up positions. A biomechanical model of breast was proposed and implemented into a finite element context to predict deformations, and from these the breast shape in different positions. The resulting shapes were compared with multimodal images, whereas the breast surface displacements were compared with manually identified landmarks and 3D scanner images. From the results, it can be concluded that the model hereby presented reasonably approximates breast response to gravity forces, therefore providing accurate and useful information to the surgeon planning such surgical procedures. © 2008 IPEM.",FALSE,

Soft fiber optic sensors for precision measurement of shear stress and pressure,Zhang Z.F.; Tao X.M.; Zhang H.P.; Zhu B.,2013,IEEE Sensors Journal,10.1109/JSEN.2012.2237393,"This paper reports a soft fiber optic sensor based on polymer fiber Bragg gratings (PFBGs) for simultaneous measurement of shear and normal stresses. The sensor comprises two PFBGs embedded in soft polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) matrix, and one of them is horizontally placed while the other is tilted. The transduction principle is that applied normal and/or shear stresses lead to deformation of the matrix and induce strains on gratings. Finite element simulation reveals non-uniform strain distribution along two fibers for direct imbedding that is verified by theoretical analysis, and therefore four gaskets are used to stretch polymer optical fibers from two ends and to produce strains on gratings. The fabricated sensor is tested by concurrently applying normal and shear forces, and Bragg wavelength shifts of two gratings were found to be linearly dependent on stresses in two directions. The measured pressure sensitivity is 0.8 pm/Pa in the range of 2.4 kPa and the shear stress sensitivity is 1.3 pm/Pa for a full range of 0.6 kPa. Such soft sensors are especially suitable for high precision measurement of contact stresses involving human skins and tissues because they are similar in Young's modulus to the used PDMS. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",FALSE,

The current development of constitutive adipose tissue models, for the implementation in multilayer computational frameworks for the simulation of human soft tissue deformations, has proved difficult because knowledge of the required mechanical parameters of fat tissue is limited. Therefore, for the first time, human abdominal adipose tissues were mechanically investigated by biaxial tensile and triaxial shear tests. The results of this study suggest that human abdominal adipose tissues under quasi-static and dynamic multiaxial loadings can be characterized as a nonlinear, anisotropic and viscoelastic soft biological material. The nonlinear and anisotropic features are consequences of the material's collagenous microstructure. The aligned collagenous septa observed in histological investigations causes the anisotropy of the tissue. A hyperelastic model used in this study was appropriate to represent the quasi-static multiaxial mechanical behavior of fat tissue.

Novel treatments involving the injection of polymeric materials into the myocardium of the failing left ventricle (LV) are currently being developed, which may reduce elevated myofiber stresses during the cardiac cycle and act to retard the progression of heart failure. A finite element (FE) simulation-based method was developed in this study that can automatically optimize the injection pattern of the polymeric ""inclusions"" according to a specific objective function, using commercially available software tools. The FE preprocessor TRUEGRID® was used to create a parametric axisymmetric LV mesh matched to experimentally measured end-diastole and end-systole metrics from dogs with coronary microembolization-induced heart failure. Passive and active myocardial material properties were defined by a pseudo-elastic-strain energy function and a time-varying elastance model of active contraction, respectively, that were implemented in the FE software LS-DYNA. The companion optimization software LS-OPT was used to communicate directly with TRUEGRID® to determine FE model parameters, such as defining the injection pattern and inclusion characteristics. The optimization resulted in an intuitive optimal injection pattern (i.e., the one with the greatest number of inclusions) when the objective function was weighted to minimize mean end-diastolic and endsystolic myofiber stress and ignore LV stroke volume. In contrast, the optimization resulted in a nonintuitive optimal pattern (i.e., 3 inclusions longitudinally X 6 inclusions circumferentially) when both myofiber stress and stroke volume were incorporated into the objective function with different weights.

Stress wave emission and cavitation bubble dynamics by nanosecond optical breakdown in a tissue phantom,Brujan E.-A.; Vogel A.,2006,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,10.1017/S0022112006000115,"Stress wave emission and cavitation bubble dynamics after optical breakdown in water and a tissue phantom with Nd: YAG laser pulses of 6 ns duration were investigated both experimentally and numerically to obtain a better understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in plasma-mediated laser surgery. Experimental tools were high-speed photography with 50 000 frames s-1, and acoustic measurements. The tissue phantom consisted of a transparent polyacrylamide (PAA) gel, the elastic properties of which can be controlled by modifying the water content. Breakdown in water produced a purely compressive stress wave. By contrast, in stiff PAA samples and for sufficiently large pulse energies, the compression wave was followed by an intense tensile wave, similar to the behaviour previously observed in cornea. The elastic/plastic response of the medium led to a significant decrease of the maximum size of the cavitation bubble and to a shortening of its oscillation period which was found to be related to the generation of the tensile stress wave upon breakdown. For increasing elastic modulus of the PAA, both the amplitudes of the bubble oscillation and of the stress wave emitted during bubble collapse decreased until the bubble oscillation was so strongly damped that no collapse stress wave was emitted. Numerical simulations were performed using a spherical model of bubble dynamics which includes the compressibility and elastic/plastic behaviour of the medium, viscosity, density and surface tension. The calculations revealed that consideration of the elastic/plastic behaviour of the medium surrounding the bubble is essential to describe the experimentally observed bipolar shape of the stress wave emitted upon optical breakdown. Water is a poor tissue model because the shape of the emitted stress waves and the bubble dynamics differ strongly for both materials. The mechanical properties of PAA were also found to be quite different from those of tissues. Experimental and numerical results provided evidence that the dynamic mechanical properties relevant for optical breakdown in PAA and tissue differ by as much as two orders of magnitude from the static values. The discovery of a tensile stress wave after optical breakdown in tissue-like media is of great importance for the assessment of collateral damage in laser surgery because biological tissues are much more susceptible to tensile stress than to compressive stress. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.",FALSE,

However, the latter cannot be explained by temperature reduction alone, and must thus be secondary to an altered biological response. In this study, we construct a computational model to calculate the heat transfer and damage accumulation in human skin during and after a burn. This enables us to assess the effectiveness of various cooling protocols (involving both free and forced convection to air and water respectively) in terms of their reduction in Arrhenius tissue damage. In this process, we propose an extension of the Arrhenius damage model in the form of a new measure ξ, which estimates the relevance of post-burn accrued damage. It was found that the reduction in Arrhenius damage integrals near the skin surface was too small to be physiologically relevant. Hence our results confirm that while the reduction in tissue temperatures is indeed quicker, the therapeutic benefit of cooling cannot be explained by thermal arguments (i.e. based on Arrhenius damage models) alone. We plan to validate this hypothesis by conducting future microarray analyses of differential gene expression in cooled and non-cooled burn lesions.

Gradient-vector-flow snake method for quantitative image reconstruction applied to mandibular distraction surgery,Tognola G.; Parazzini M.; Pedretti G.; Ravazzani P.; Grandori F.; Pesatori A.; Norgia M.; Svelto C.,2009,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,10.1109/TIM.2009.2015525,"To improve planning of maxillofacial surgery, a novel method for maxillary-, mandibular-, and facial-nerve 3-D image reconstruction was implemented and optimized. A set of images acquired by a computed tomography (CT) scanner was segmented to reconstruct the 3-D model of the maxilla and mandible. Particular attention was given to the segmentation of the facial nerve, which was obtained through the gradient-vector-flow (GVF) snake method. After segmentation, precise anatomical 3-D plastic models were fabricated through stereolithography from CT scans of five clinical cases that will undergo either dental implant surgery or bone distraction. For all cases, 3-D models delivered essential visual and tactile information for the planning and simulation of surgery as well as for customized implant preparation. © 2009 IEEE.",FALSE,
Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks,"Isola, Phillip and Zhu, Jun-Yan and Zhou, Tinghui and Efros, Alexei A",2017,,,"Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. Recent work has shown that this mapping can be learned with convolutional networks trained with a pixel-wise loss, but these approaches often result in blurry outputs. We propose a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems using conditional adversarial networks, which learn a loss function to train the mapping. Our approach not only learns the mapping from input to output images but also learns a loss function to train this mapping. We demonstrate that this approach is effective for a wide variety of problems, including synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among others. Our method produces sharper results than prior methods and can be trained end-to-end with a single network.",FALSE,
Mathematical modeling of laser lipolysis,Mordon S.R.; Wassmer B.; Reynaud J.P.; Zemmouri J.,2008,BioMedical Engineering Online,10.1186/1475-925X-7-10,"Background and Objectives: Liposuction continues to be one of the most popular procedures performed in cosmetic surgery. As the public's demand for body contouring continues, laser lipolysis has been proposed to improve results, minimize risk, optimize patient comfort, and reduce the recovery period. Mathematical modeling of laser lipolysis could provide a better understanding of the laser lipolysis process and could determine the optimal dosage as a function of fat volume to be removed. Study design/Materials and Methods: An Optical-Thermal-Damage Model was formulated using finite-element modeling software (Femlab 3.1, Comsol Inc). The general model simulated light distribution using the diffusion approximation of the transport theory, temperature rise using the bioheat equation and laser-induced injury using the Arrhenius damage model. Biological tissue was represented by two homogenous regions (dermis and fat layer) with a nonlinear air-tissue boundary condition including free convection. Video recordings were used to gain a better understanding of the back and forth movement of the cannula during laser lipolysis in order to consider them in our mathematical model. Infrared video recordings were also performed in order to compare the actual surface temperatures to our calculations. The reduction in fat volume was determined as a function of the total applied energy and subsequently compared to clinical data reported in the literature. Results: In patients, when using cooled tumescent anesthesia, 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser or 980 nm diode laser: (6 W, back and forth motion: 100 mm/s) give similar skin surface temperature (max: 41°C). These measurements are in accordance with those obtained by mathematical modeling performed with a 1 mm cannula inserted inside the hypodermis layer at 0.8 cm below the surface. Similarly, the fat volume reduction observed in patients at 6-month follow up can be determined by mathematical modeling. This fat reduction depends on the applied energy, typically 5 cm3 for 3000 J. At last, skin retraction was observed in patients at 6-month follow up. This observation can be easily explained by mathematical modeling showing that the temperature increase inside the lower dermis is sufficient (48-50°C) to induce skin tightening Discussion and Conclusion: Laser lipolysis can be described by a theoretical model. Fat volume reduction observed in patients is in accordance with model calculations. Due to heat diffusion, temperature elevation is also produced inside the lower reticular dermis. This interesting observation can explain remodeling of the collagenous tissue, with clinically evident skin tightening. In conclusion, while the heat generated by interstitial laser irradiation provides stimulate lipolysis of the fat cells, the collagen and elastin are also stimulated resulting in a tightening in the skin. This mathematical model should serve as a useful tool to simulate and better understand the mechanism of action of the laser lipolysis. © 2008 Mordon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",TRUE,"Focuses on math models, not on predicting or evaluating looks."
Real-time endovascular guidewire position simulation using shortest path algorithms,Schafer S.; Singh V.; Noël P.B.; Walczak A.M.; Xu J.; Hoffmann K.R.,2009,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-009-0385-z,"Purpose: Treatment of vascular disease often involves endovascular interventions which use the vascular system for delivering treatment devices via a previously inserted guidewire to the diseased site. Previous studies show relative reproducibility of guidewire position after insertion, indicating that the guidewire position is constrained and could be represented by an energy minimization approach. Such representation would support the surgeon's decision process in guidewire selection. Methods: In this paper, we determine the guidewire position using a k-level graph based on 3D vessel information. Guidewire properties are incorporated into the graph as edge weights given by the local bending energy related to the local bending angle. The optimal path through this weighted directed graph is determined using a shortest path algorithm. Volumetric data of two different internal carotid artery phantoms (Ø 3.5-4.6 mm) was acquired. Two guidewires (Ø 0.33 mm) of different material properties (stainless steel, plastic-coated steel core) were inserted into the phantoms. Results: The average RMS distance between actual and simulated guidewire positions varies from 0.9 mm (plastic coated) to 1.3 mm (stainless steel); the computation time to determine the position was <2s. Conclusions: The results indicate that the proposed technique yields reproducible and accurate guidewire positions within a short, clinically relevant time frame. These calculated positions may be useful in facilitating neurovascular interventions. © CARS 2009.",FALSE,
Simulation Based Design and Evaluation of a Transcatheter Mitral Heart Valve Frame,Young M.; Erdemir A.; Stucke S.; Klatte R.; Davis B.; Navia J.L.,2012,"Journal of Medical Devices, Transactions of the ASME",10.1115/1.4007182,"In certain populations, open heart surgery to replace a diseased mitral valve is not an option, leaving percutaneous delivery a viable alternative. However, a surgical transcatheter based delivery of a metallic support frame incorporating a tissue derived valve puts considerable constraints on device specifications. Expansion to a large diameter from the catheter diameter without mechanical fracture involves advanced device design and appropriate material processing and selection. In this study, a new frame concept is presented with a desirable feature that incorporates wings that protrude during expansion to establish adequate fixation. Expansion characteristics of the design in relation to annulus fixation were quantified through finite element analysis predictions of the frame wing span and angles. Computational modeling and simulation was used to identify many favorable design features for the transcatheter mitral valve frame and obtain desired expansion diameters (35-45 mm), acceptable radial stiffness (2.7 N/mm), and ensure limited risk of failure based on predicted plastic deformations. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.",FALSE,

Growth on demand: Reviewing the mechanobiology of stretched skin,Zöllner A.M.; Holland M.A.; Honda K.S.; Gosain A.K.; Kuhl E.,2013,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2013.03.018,"Skin is a highly dynamic, autoregulated, living system that responds to mechanical stretch through a net gain in skin surface area. Tissue expansion uses the concept of controlled overstretch to grow extra skin for defect repair in situ. While the short-term mechanics of stretched skin have been studied intensely by testing explanted tissue samples ex vivo, we know very little about the long-term biomechanics and mechanobiology of living skin in vivo. Here we explore the long-term effects of mechanical stretch on the characteristics of living skin using a mathematical model for skin growth. We review the molecular mechanisms by which skin responds to mechanical loading and model their effects collectively in a single scalar-valued internal variable, the surface area growth. This allows us to adopt a continuum model for growing skin based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into a reversible elastic and an irreversible growth part. To demonstrate the inherent modularity of this approach, we implement growth as a user-defined constitutive subroutine into the general purpose implicit finite element program Abaqus/Standard. To illustrate the features of the model, we simulate the controlled area growth of skin in response to tissue expansion with multiple filling points in time. Our results demonstrate that the field theories of continuum mechanics can reliably predict the manipulation of thin biological membranes through mechanical overstretch. Our model could serve as a valuable tool to rationalize clinical process parameters such as expander geometry, expander size, filling volume, filling pressure, and inflation timing to minimize tissue necrosis and maximize patient comfort in plastic and reconstructive surgery. While initially developed for growing skin, our model can easily be generalized to arbitrary biological structures to explore the physiology and pathology of stretch-induced growth of other living systems such as hearts, arteries, bladders, intestines, ureters, muscles, and nerves. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",TRUE,"Talks about skin growth modeling, not surgery aesthetics prediction."

The authors present a case where two relatively large, adjacent cranial defects were repaired by custom computer-designed titanium plates. The two plates were designed and fabricated simultaneously using a unique methodology. A 28-year-old woman underwent a corpus callosotomy for medically intractable epilepsy. The surgery was complicated by unexpected haemorrhage which necessitated a second craniotomy. Subsequent deep infection required the removal of bilateral bone flaps, presenting a challenge in the reconstruction of extensive, bilateral but asymmetrical cranial defects. The patient underwent a head computed tomography scan, from which a rapid-prototype model of the skull was produced. The surfaces for the missing cranial segments were generated virtually using a combination of software products and two titanium plates that followed these virtual contours were manufactured to cover the defects. The cranioplasty procedure to implant both titanium cranial plates was performed efficiently with no intra-operative complications. Intra-operatively, an excellent fit was achieved. The careful planning of the plates enhanced the relative ease with which the cranial defects were repaired with an excellent cosmetic outcome. © IMechE 2011.",FALSE,

Reconstruction of 3D human facial images using partial differential equations,Elyan E.; Ugail H.,2007,Journal of Computers,10.4304/jcp.2.8.1-8,"One of the challenging problems in geometric modeling and computer graphics is the construction of realistic human facial geometry. Such geometry are essential for a wide range of applications, such as 3D face recognition, virtual reality applications, facial expression simulation and computer based plastic surgery application. This paper addresses a method for the construction of 3D geometry of human faces based on the use of Elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDE). Here the geometry corresponding to a human face is treated as a set of surface patches, whereby each surface patch is represented using four boundary curves in the 3-space that formulate the appropriate boundary conditions for the chosen PDE. These boundary curves are extracted automatically using 3D data of human faces obtained using a 3D scanner. The solution of the PDE generates a continuous single surface patch describing the geometry of the original scanned data. In this study, through a number of experimental verifications we have shown the efficiency of the PDE based method for 3D facial surface reconstruction using scan data. In addition to this, we also show that our approach provides an efficient way of facial representation using a small set of parameters that could be utilized for efficient facial data storage and verification purposes. © 2006 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.",FALSE,
Thermal damage patterns of diode hair-removal lasers according to various skin types and hair densities and colors: A simulation study,Shirkavand A.; Ataie-Fashtami L.; Sarkar S.; Alinaghizadeh M.R.; Fateh M.; Zand N.; Djavid G.E.,2012,Photomedicine and Laser Surgery,10.1089/pho.2011.3152,"Background and objective: It is important to prevent unwanted side effects of diode hair-removal lasers especially in dark skin tones. This study simulates the thermal damage patterns caused by diode hair-removal lasers in different skin types, hair colors, and hair densities. Materials and methods: LITCIT software has been used with the tissue modeled as two components, the skin and the hair. The absorption coefficients of various skin types (f mel=5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), laser parameters, and optothermal properties of tissue were inputs. Results: For all skin types there was a significant unwanted thermal damage to the epidermis as a result of fluence increase. Using longer pulse durations is accompanied by effective thermal damage to the hair follicle, while preserving the epidermis in skin types II and III, an effect not achieved in darker skins. Regardless of pulse duration, when the distance between hair follicles is ≤0.5 mm, there is a significant increase in thermal damage to interfollicular epidermis with high fluences compared with lower hair densities (interfollicular space≥1 mm). In lighter hairs, while using longer pulse durations, higher fluences are needed in order to obtain the same level of thermal damage in the hair follicle as shorter pulse widths. Conclusions: In lighter skin types, lengthening the pulse duration of diode lasers (up to 400 ms) increases efficacy while preserving epidermis from unwanted thermal damage. However, it is necessary to use lower fluences while using longer pulse duration to avoid irreversible thermal damage to epidermis in darker tones, as is also true for locations with higher hair densities. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",TRUE,"Focuses on laser hair removal damage, not surgery outcome prediction."

Bones, muscles, skin, fat, and superficial musculoaponeurotic system were reconstructed from magnetic resonance images and modeled according to anatomical, plastic, and reconstructive surgery literature. The finite element mesh, composed of hexahedron elements, was generated through a semi-automatic procedure with an effective compromise between the detailed representation of anatomical parts and the limitation of the computational time. Nonlinear constitutive equations are implemented in the finite element model. The corresponding model parameters were selected according to previous work with mechanical measurements on soft facial tissue, or based on reasonable assumptions. Model assumptions concerning tissue geometry, interactions, mechanical properties, and the boundary conditions were validated through comparison with experiments. The calculated response of facial tissues to gravity loads, to the application of a pressure inside the oral cavity and to the application of an imposed displacement was shown to be in good agreement with the data from corresponding magnetic resonance images and holographic measurements. As a first application, gravimetric soft tissue descent was calculated from the long time action of gravity on the face in the erect position, with tissue aging leading to a loss of stiffness.

Simulation of color perception of layered dental composites using optical properties to evaluate the benefit of esthetic layer preparation technique,Friebel M.; Pernell O.; Cappius H.-J.; Helfmann J.; Meinke M.C.,2012,Dental Materials,10.1016/j.dental.2011.11.017,"Objectives: Esthetic restorations require that dental restorative materials have similar optical properties to teeth. To improve the color perception, the inhomogeneous morphology of the native tooth can be imitated by layering two optically different restorative materials. However until now the benefit of this method has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Methods: The optical parameters, absorption coefficient μa, scattering coefficient μs, anisotropy factor g and effective scattering coefficient μ′s, were determined for the enamel and dentin material of the restorative material systems Artemis® and Herculite XRV®. This was carried out for each material system in the wavelength range between 400 and 700 nm using integrating sphere measurements followed by inverse Monte Carlo simulations. Results: Using the optical parameters and a forward Monte Carlo simulation, the color perception of layered samples could be predicted with a sufficient degree of accuracy. The total color impression was shown to be dependent on the sample thickness and the transparency/translucency of the single layers of enamel and dentin materials. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that the use of two materials is well-suited for the restoration of front teeth with their relatively high proportion of enamel.

Simulating the wrinkling and aging of skin with a multi-layer finite element model,Flynn C.; McCormack B.A.O.,2010,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.10.007,"One of the outward signs of the aging process of human skin is the increased appearance of wrinkles on its surface. Clinical studies show that the increased frequency of wrinkles with age may be attributed to changes in the composition of the various layers of skin, leading to a change in mechanical properties. A parameter study was performed on a previously proposed multi-layer finite element model of skin. A region of skin was subject to an in-plane compression, resulting in wrinkling. A number of physical properties of the skin model were changed and the effects these changes had on the size of the subsequent wrinkles were measured. Reducing the moisture content of the stratum corneum by 11% produces wrinkles 25-85% larger. Increasing the dermal collagen fibre density by 67%, results in wrinkles, which are 25-50% larger. A reduction and change in the pre-stress distribution in the skin model, which represents the natural tension and relaxed skin tension lines in real skin, also influences the wrinkle height in a similar manner to real aging skin. Typically, there can be up to a 100% increase in the height of wrinkles as skin ages. This model would be of benefit in the development of cosmetic moisturisers and plastic-surgery techniques to reduce the appearance of aging. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",FALSE,

An analytical model is derived for this case under assumptions typically made in the literature and comparisons between the CFD study and the analytical model are presented.

Current manual landmark and surface-based techniques are time-consuming and not always accurate. Intraoperative ultrasound imaging of the vertebrae, combined with automated registration, could improve surgery by improving accuracy, reducing operative time, and decreasing invasiveness. Methods: We present a simple ultrasound-CT registration technique that is automated, accurate, and robust. Registration is achieved by aligning the posterior vertebral surface, extracted from both CT and ultrasound images, using a forward and a backward scan line tracing method, respectively. The registration technique is validated using a simple plastic phantom in a water bath and a more realistic porcine cadaver in a simulation of open back surgery. Results: Clinically relevant accuracy was estimated by comparing automated registrations with gold standard imaging fiducial-based reference transformations, which yielded target registration errors of under 1 mm for the plastic phantom and under 1.6 mm for the porcine cadaver. Conclusions: Our registration technique demonstrates good accuracy and robustness under clinically realistic conditions and thus warrants further studies on its surgical application. © 2010 CARS.",FALSE,
Empirical relationship between lengthening an anterior cruciate ligament graft and increases in knee anterior laxity: A human cadaveric study,Grover D.; Thompson D.; Hull M.L.; Howell S.M.,2006,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.2378931,"Lengthening of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft construct can occur as a result of lengthening at the sites of tibial and/or femoral fixation and manifests as an increase in anterior laxity. Although lengthening at the site of fixation has been measured for a variety of fixation devices, it is difficult to place these results in a clinical context because the mathematical relationship between lengthening of an ACL graft construct and anterior laxity is unknown. The purpose of our study was to determine empirically this relationship. Ten cadaveric knees were reconstructed with a double-looped tendon graft. With the knee in 25° of flexion, the position of the proximal end of the graft inside the femoral tunnel was adjusted by moving the femoral fixation device until the anterior laxity at an applied anterior force of 134 N matched that of the intact knee. In random order, the graft construct was lengthened 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mm by moving the femoral fixation device distally along the femoral tunnel and anterior laxity was measured. The increase in the length of the graft construct was related to the increase in anterior laxity by a simple linear regression model. Lengthening the graft construct from 1 to 5 mm caused an equal increase in anterior laxity (slope = 1.0 mm/mm, r2=0.800, p<0.0001). Because an anterior laxity increase of 3 mm or greater in a reconstructed knee is considered unstable clinically and because many fixation devices in widespread use clinically allow 3 mm or greater of lengthening in in vitro tests, our empirical relationship indicates that lengthening at the site of fixation probably is an important cause of knee instability following ACL reconstructive surgery. Our empirical relation also indicates that an important criterion in the design of future fixation devices is that lengthening at the sites affixation in in vitro tests should be limited to less than 3 mm.

A bounded iterative closest point method for minimally invasive registration of the femur,Rodriguez Y Baena F.; Hawke T.; Jakopec M.,2013,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine",10.1177/0954411913500948,"This article describes a novel method for image-based, minimally invasive registration of the femur, for application to computer-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. The method is adapted from the well-known iterative closest point algorithm. By utilising an estimate of the hip centre on both the preoperative model and intraoperative patient anatomy, the proposed 'bounded' iterative closest point algorithm robustly produces accurate varus-valgus and anterior-posterior femoral alignment with minimal distal access requirements. Similar to the original iterative closest point implementation, the bounded iterative closest point algorithm converges monotonically to the closest minimum, and the presented case includes a common method for global minimum identification. The bounded iterative closest point method has shown to have exceptional resistance to noise during feature acquisition through simulations and in vitro plastic bone trials, where its performance is compared to a standard form of the iterative closest point algorithm. © IMechE 2013.",FALSE,
A continuum model for the bio-mechanical interactions between living tissue and bio-resorbable graft after bone reconstructive surgery,Madeo A.; Lekszycki T.; dell'Isola F.,2011,Comptes Rendus - Mecanique,10.1016/j.crme.2011.07.004,"We introduce a two-constituent porous continuum as a model describing the long-term growth/resorption phenomena in bone tissues grafted with bio-resorbable materials as driven by mechanical loads. The proposed model is able to account for the interplay between mechanical and biological phenomena which are known to be important for the bone tissue synthesis and the resorption of both bone tissue and bio-material. In particular, in the presented model the Lagrangian apparent mass densities of the natural bone and of the artificial material evolve in time according to precise ordinary differential equations. These latter are obtained by postulating a growth/resorption law and suitable constitutive equations conceived to account for the influence on bone resorption and synthesis of the action of different applied external loads as mediated by biological stimulus. The considered constitutive equations are chosen on the basis of the known biological phenomena occurring in bone resorption and synthesis. We present some numerical simulations for rod-bones subjected to axial external load. These numerical simulations allow for the description of the most desirable situation in which a gradual resorption of the artificial material takes place together with the contemporary formation of new bone, finally giving rise to an almost complete replacement of the artificial material with natural living tissue. © 2011 Académie des sciences.",FALSE,
Laser transport through thin scattering layers,Eze R.; Kumar S.,2010,Applied Optics,10.1364/AO.49.000358,"Many modern applications of lasers involve understanding the transport of radiation through thin layers. The interactions of continuous wave and pulsed lasers with skin in dermatological use related to surgery and cosmetic procedures are examples of such. These highly scattering thin layers in skin are best modeled by the Monte Carlo method. However, most traditional Monte Carlo models may inaccurately account for the presence of thin layers. As an example, the very thin epidermis, with its highly absorbing melanin, is known to influence the laser penetration significantly. If the Monte Carlo model is implemented without special features, then the results of the simulation will show incorrect effects of thin layers because the path length of most photons would be significantly larger than the layer thickness. As a result, the computed photon travel path length would simply not feel the presence of the layer. In this paper, we present numerical and algorithmic features for computation of radiation transport through thin layers. It is noted that, while Monte Carlo without special features smears the radiative effect of the layers, the refined technique indicates that layers have a great impact on the absorption of energy, especially if the layer properties are distinctly different from those of the adjacent layers. The results have significant implications in the study of diagnostic and therapeutic applications of lasers in biomedicine and surgery. © 2010 Optical Society of America.",FALSE,
Extraction and reconstruction of retinal vasculature,Fadzil M.H.A.; Izhar L.I.; Venkatachalam P.A.; Karunakar T.V.N.,2007,Journal of Medical Engineering and Technology,10.1080/03091900601111201,"Information about retinal vasculature morphology is used in grading the severity and progression of diabetic retinopathy. An image analysis system can help ophthalmologists make accurate and efficient diagnoses. This paper presents the development of an image processing algorithm for detecting and reconstructing retinal vasculature. The detection of the vascular structure is achieved by image enhancement using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization followed by the extraction of the vessels using bottom-hat morphological transformation. For reconstruction of the complete retinal vasculature, a region growing technique based on first-order Gaussian derivative is developed. The technique incorporates both gradient magnitude change and average intensity as the homogeneity criteria that enable the process to adapt to intensity changes and intensity spread over the vasculature region. The reconstruction technique reduces the required number of seeds to near optimal for the region growing process. It also overcomes poor performance of current seed-based methods, especially with low and inconsistent contrast images as normally seen in vasculature regions of fundus images. Simulations of the algorithm on 20 test images from the DRIVE database show that it outperforms many other published methods and achieved an accuracy range (ability to detect both vessel and non-vessel pixels) of 0.91-0.95, a sensitivity range (ability to detect vessel pixels) of 0.91-0.95 and a specificity range (ability to detect non-vessel pixels) of 0.88-0.94. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.",FALSE,

Nonlinear finite element simulation to elucidate the efficacy of slit arteriotomy for end-to-side arterial anastomosis in microsurgery,Gu H.; Chua A.; Tan B.-K.; Chew Hung K.,2006,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.12.015,"The slit arteriotomy for end-to-side arterial microanastomosis is a technique used to revascularize free flaps in reconstructive surgery. Does a slit open to a width sufficient for blood supply? How is the slit opening affected by factors, such as arterial wall thickness and material stiffness? To answer these questions we propose a nonlinear finite element procedure to simulate the operation. Through modeling the arteries using hyperelastic shell elements, our simulation reveals that the slit opens up to a width even larger than the original diameter of the donor artery, allowing sufficient blood supply. It also identifies two factors that explain the opening of the slit: blood pressure which is predominant in most cases, and the forces applied to the slit by the donor artery. During simulation, when we increase the donor artery thickness and stiffness, it is found that the contribution of blood pressure to the slit opening decreases while that of the forces applied by the donor artery increases. This result indicates that sometimes the forces applied by the donor artery can play an even more significant role than the blood pressure factor. Our simulation elucidates the efficacy of the slit arteriotomy. It improves our understanding of the interplay between blood pressure and donor vessel factors in keeping the slit open.",FALSE,

To this goal, our system compares the 3-D scan of the patient with a database of scans of harmonious faces, excluding the feature to be corrected. Then, the corresponding features of the k most similar harmonious faces, as well as their average, are suitably pasted onto the patients face, producing k1 aesthetically effective surgery simulations.

First, thin-plate spline (TPS) is used to improve eyes' ratio. Then, the composite normal map is created by integrating the reference normal map's double-eyelid area into the patient's transformed normal map seamlessly, which is key to simulation of the double eyelid crease.

Fracture simulation of restored teeth using a continuum damage mechanics failure model,Li H.; Li J.; Zou Z.; Fok A.S.-L.,2011,Dental Materials,10.1016/j.dental.2011.03.006,"Objective: The aim of this paper is to validate the use of a finite-element (FE) based continuum damage mechanics (CDM) failure model to simulate the debonding and fracture of restored teeth. Materials and methods: Fracture testing of plastic model teeth, with or without a standard Class-II MOD (mesial-occusal-distal) restoration, was carried out to investigate their fracture behavior. In parallel, 2D FE models of the teeth are constructed and analyzed using the commercial FE software ABAQUS. A CDM failure model, implemented into ABAQUS via the user element subroutine (UEL), is used to simulate the debonding and/or final fracture of the model teeth under a compressive load. The material parameters needed for the CDM model to simulate fracture are obtained through separate mechanical tests. The predicted results are then compared with the experimental data of the fracture tests to validate the failure model. Results: The failure processes of the intact and restored model teeth are successfully reproduced by the simulation. However, the fracture parameters obtained from testing small specimens need to be adjusted to account for the size effect. The results indicate that the CDM model is a viable model for the prediction of debonding and fracture in dental restorations. © 2011 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

An examination was made of the Biomet Uniflex reconstruction nail, the Biomet Vector nail, and the Stryker Howmedica Long Gamma nail in the fixation of an unstable subtrochanteric femur fracture model, using a synthetic bone model. Mean stiffness for each nail was initially determined in control specimens (i.e. no fracture and no instrumentation). The nail stiffness values were 1764.0N/mm (controls), 373.61N/mm (Uniflex), 294.27N/mm (vector), and 656.36N/mm (Gamma). The Gamma was statistically stiffer than the Uniflex and Vector (p<0.002). Mean fatigue life measurements were: Uniflex at 52 891 cycles, failing at the most distal of the proximal two screw holes; Vector at 45 344 cycles, failing in the nail at the level of the fracture site; Gamma at 88 748 cycles failing at the lag screw hole. The p value between the Gamma and Vector was less than 0.01 and between Gamma and Uniflex was less than 0.05. The mean maximal axial displacement at the fracture site was 2.448 mm, 2.305 mm, and 0.790 mm for the Uniflex, Vector and Gamma, respectively.

The focus of this research is on mitral valve repair by robot-assisted surgery (RAS) method with tactile feedback. Heart tissue is considered to be touched by a tactile sensor with considering the friction effect. A regularized Coulomb law analogous to elastoplastic theory is used to represent the friction. Since the heart tissue is subjected to repeated loading condition, a generalized standard solid chain is chosen for modeling the heart tissue. To implement the generalized standard solid chain in finite element analysis (FEA), a new splitting strategy is presented. The splitting strategy avoids the complicated conversion procedure from creep function to relaxation function by dividing the total problem into several subproblems. The penalty method is used in the derivation of continuum model for the interaction between the tactile sensor and the tissue.

However, in patients with endotracheal tubes, further surgery has to be performed to improve cough effectiveness. Thus, it is necessary to analyze how this process is carried out in healthy tracheas to suggest ways to improve its efficacy in operated patients. A finite element model of a human trachea is developed and used to analyze the deformability of the tracheal walls under coughing. The geometry of the trachea is obtained from CT of a 70-year-old male patient. A fluid structure interaction approach is used to analyze the deformation of the wall when the fluid (in this case, air) flows inside the trachea. A structured hexahedral-based grid for the tracheal walls and an unstructured tetrahedral-based mesh with coincident nodes for the fluid are used to perform the simulations with the finite element-based commercial software code (ADINA R&D Inc.). Tracheal wall is modeled as an anisotropic fiber reinforced hyperelastic solid material in which the different orientation of the fibers is introduced. The implantation of an endotracheal prosthesis is simulated. Boundary conditions for breathing and coughing are applied at the inlet and at the outlet surfaces of the fluid mesh. The collapsibility of a human trachea under breathing and coughing is shown in terms of flow patterns and wall stresses. The ability of the model to reproduce the normal breathing and coughing is proved by comparing the deformed shape of the trachea with experimental results. Moreover the implantation of an endotracheal prosthesis would be related with a decrease of coughing efficiency, as clinically seen. © 2010 Biomedical Engineering Society.",FALSE,

Application of such a methodology to quantitatively compare postoperative hemodynamics in congenital heart diseases is very promising. In the treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which is a congenital heart disease where the left ventricle is missing or very small, the necessity to feed the pulmonary and systemic circulations is obtained with an interposition shunt. Two main options are available and differ from the sites of anastomoses: (i) the systemic-to-pulmonary conduit (Blalock-Taussig shunt known as the Norwood Operation (NO)) connecting the innominate artery (NO-BT) or the aorta (NO-CS) to the right pulmonary artery and (ii) the right ventricle to pulmonary artery shunt (known as Sano operation (SO)). The proposition that the SO is superior to the NO remains controversial. 3-D computer models of the NO (NO-BT and NO-CS) and SO were developed and investigated using the finite volume method. Conduits of 3, 3.5 and 4 mm were used in the NO models, whereas conduits of 4, 5 and 6 mm were used in the SO model. The hydraulic nets (lumped resistances, compliances, inertances and elastances) which represent the systemic, coronary and pulmonary circulations and the heart were identical in the two models. A multiscale approach was adopted to couple the 3-D models with the circulation net. Computer simulation results were compared with post-operative catheterization data. Results showed that (i) there is a good correlation between predicted and observed data: higher aortic diastolic pressure, decreased pulmonary arterial pressure, lower pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio and higher coronary perfusion pressure in SO; (ii) there is a minimal regurgitant flow in the SO conduit.

Cell culture results indicate that CMPC is biocompatible and could support cell attachment and proliferation. To investigate the in vivo biocompatibility and osteogenesis, the CMPC samples were implanted into bone defects in rabbits. Histological evaluation showed that the introduction of MPC into CPC enhanced the efficiency of new bone formation. CMPC also exhibited good biocompatibility, biodegradability and osteoconductivity with host bone in vivo. The results obtained suggest that CMPC, having met the basic requirements of bone tissue engineering, might have a significant clinical advantage over CPC, and may have the potential to be applied in orthopedic, reconstructive and maxillofacial surgery. © 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.",FALSE,
Computational mechanics of Nitinol stent grafts,Kleinstreuer C.; Li Z.; Basciano C.A.; Seelecke S.; Farber M.A.,2008,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.05.032,"A finite element analysis of tubular, diamond-shaped stent grafts under representative cyclic loading conditions for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is presented. Commercial software was employed to study the mechanical behavior and fatigue performance of different materials found in commercially available stent-graft systems. Specifically, the effects of crimping, deployment, and cyclic pressure loading on stent-graft fatigue life, radial force, and wall compliances were simulated and analyzed for two types of realistic but different Nitinol materials (NITI-1 and NITI-2) and grafts (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene-ePTFE and polyethylene therephthalate-PET). The results show that NITI-1 stent has a better crimping performance than NITI-2. Under representative cyclic pressure loading, both NITI-1 and NITI-2 sealing stents are located in the safe zone of the fatigue-life diagram; however, the fatigue resistance of an NITI-1 stent is better than that of an NITI-2 stent. It was found that the two types of sealing stents do not damage a healthy neck artery. In the aneurysm section, the NITI-1&ePTFE, NITI-1&PET, and NITI-2&PET combinations were free of fatigue fracture when subjected to conditions of radial stress between 50 and 150 mmHg. In contrast, the safety factor for the NITI-2&ePFTE combination was only 0.67, which is not acceptable for proper AAA stent-graft design. In summary, a Nitinol stent with PET graft may greatly improve fatigue life, while its compliance is much lower than the NITI-ePTFE combination. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",FALSE,
Foam-like scaffolds for bone tissue engineering based on a novel couple of silicate-phosphate specular glasses: Synthesis and properties,Vitale-Brovarone C.; Baino F.; Bretcanu O.; Verné E.,2009,Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine,10.1007/s10856-009-3788-z,"Glass-ceramic scaffolds mimicking the structure of cancellous bone were produced via sponge replication technique by using a polyurethane foam as template and glass powder below 30 μm as inorganic phase. Specifically, a SiO2-based glass of complex composition and its corresponding P2O5-based ""specular"" glass were used as materials for scaffolding. The polymeric sponge was thermally removed and the glass powders were sintered to obtain a replica of the template structure. The scaffolds were investigated and compared from a structural, morphological and mechanical viewpoint by assessing their crystalline phases, volumetric shrinkage, pores content and interconnection, mechanical strength. In addition, the scaffolds were soaked in acellular simulated body fluid to investigate their in vitro behaviour.

An intraoperative beta probe dedicated to glioma surgery: Design and feasibility study,Bonzom S.; Ménard L.; Pitre S.; Duval M.A.; Siebert R.; Palfi S.; Pinot L.; Lefebvre F.; Charon Y.,2007,IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science,10.1109/TNS.2006.885574,"Surgery is considered as the primary therapeutic procedure for gliomas and several recent clinical studies have shown that total tumor resection is directly associated with longer survival when compared to subtotal resection. In order to refine the resection in the boundaries of gliomas, we are developing an intraoperative probe specifically dedicated to the localization of residual tumor labeled with positron emitters. The probe is designed to be compact and electrically safe in order to be directly coupled to the excision tool leading to simultaneous detection and removal of tumor tissues. It is built with clear and plastic scintillating fibers held in a closed packed annular arrangement ensheathing the excision tool. The annihilation γ ray background is eliminated by a real-time subtraction method. Validation of the technical choice and optimization of the probe geometry were performed by preliminary measurements and Monte Carlo simulations based on the MCNP-4C code and an anthropomorphic brain phantom. The theoretical probe sensitivity was found to be 82 cps/μCi/ml with a γ ray rejection efficiency of 99.6%. The expected minimum radio-tracer detectable concentration for tumors labeled with 18F-FET was 0.10 μCi/ml.

Low-level laser therapy on the viability of skin flap in rats subjected to deleterious effect of nicotine,Das Neves L.M.S.; Marcolino A.M.; Prado R.P.; De Souza Ribeiro T.; Pinfildi C.E.; Thomazini J.A.,2011,Photomedicine and Laser Surgery,10.1089/pho.2010.2883,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of 830-nm laser in blocking the action of nicotine on the viability of skin flap. Background data: The authors have analyzed the deleterious effect of cigarette smoke or nicotine on the skin flap alone with evidence of increased skin necrosis in the flap. Materials and methods: Twenty-four Wistar-albino rats were divided into three groups of eight animals each: Group 1 (control), subjected to a surgical technique to obtain a flap for cranial base, laser irradiation simulation, and a subcutaneous injection of saline; Group 2, similar to Group 1, with subcutaneous injection of nicotine (2 mg/kg/day) for a period of 1 week before and 1 week after surgery; and Group 3, similar to Group 2, with skin flaps subjected to a λ 830-nm laser irradiation. The laser parameters used were: power 30 mW, beam area 0.07cm2, irradiance 429 mW/cm 2, irradiation time 84 sec, total energy 2.52 J, and energy density 36J/cm2. The laser was used immediately after surgery and for 4 consecutive days, in one point at 2.5 cm of the flap cranial base. The areas of necrosis were examined by two macroscopic analyses: paper template and Mini-Mop®. The pervious blood vessels were also counted. Results: The results were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and post-test contrast orthogonal method (multiple comparisons), showing that the laser decreased the area of necrosis in flaps subjected to nicotine, and consequently, increased the number of blood vessels (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The laser proved to be an effective way to decrease the area of necrosis in rats subjected to nicotine, making them similar to the control group.

Development and validation methodology of the Nuss procedure surgical planner,Rechowicz K.J.; McKenzie F.D.,2013,SIMULATION,10.1177/0037549713496153,"Surgical planners are used to achieve the optimal outcome for surgery. They are especially desired in procedures where a positive aesthetic outcome is the primary goal, such as the Nuss procedure which is a minimally invasive surgery for correcting pectus excavatum (PE) – a congenital chest wall deformity which is characterized by a deep depression of the sternum. The Nuss procedure consists of placement of a metal bar(s) underneath the sternum, thereby forcibly changing the geometry of the ribcage. Because of the prevalence of PE and the popularity of the Nuss procedure, the demand to perform this surgery is greater than ever. Therefore, a Nuss procedure surgical planner is an invaluable planning tool ensuring an optimal physiological and aesthetic outcome. We propose the development and validation of the Nuss procedure planner. First, a generic model of the ribcage is developed. Then, the computed tomography (CT) data collected from actual patients with PE is used to create a set of patient-specific finite element models (FEM). Based on finite element analyses (FEA) a force–displacement data set is created. This data is used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to generalize the data set. In order to evaluate the planning process, a methodology which uses an average shape of the chest for comparison with results of the Nuss procedure planner is developed. Haptic feedback and inertial tracking is also implemented. The results show that it is possible to utilize this approximation of the force–displacement model for a Nuss procedure planner and trainer. © 2013, The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.

Stability of cervical spine after one-level corpectomy using different numbers of screws and plate systems,Rosli R.; Kadir M.R.A.; Kamarul T.,2014,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine",10.1177/0954411914527074,"Anterior corpectomy and reconstruction using a plate with locking screws are standard procedures for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Although adding more screws to the construct will normally result in improved fixation stability, several issues need to be considered. Past reports have suggested that increasing the number of screws can result in the increase in spinal rigidity, decreased spine mobility, loss of bone and, possibly, screw loosening. In order to overcome this, options to have constrained, semi-constrained or hybrid screw and plate systems were later introduced. The purpose of this study is to compare the stability achieved by four and two screws using different plate systems after one-level corpectomy with placement of cage. A three-dimensional finite-element model of an intact C1-C7 segment was developed from computer tomography data sets, including the cortical bone, soft tissue and simulated corpectomy fusion at C4-C5. A spinal cage and an anterior cervical plate with different numbers of screws and plate systems were constructed to a fit one-level corpectomy of C5. Moment load of 1.0 N m was applied to the superior surface of C1, with C7 was fixed in all degrees of freedom. The kinematic stability of a two-screw plate was found to be statistically equivalent to a four-screw plate for one-level corpectomy. Thus, it can be a better option of fusion and infers comparable stability after one-level anterior cervical corpectomy, instead of a four-screw plate.© IMechE 2014.",FALSE,

The purpose of this study was to establish a computed tomography (CT) based three-dimensional assistant plastic surgery systems, which can provide the patients with realistic prediction of their own postoperative appearance in computer and specifically produce a nose implant for an individual patient. Preoperative CT data and 3D reconstruction techniques were employed to generate 3D model of the patient's skull. 3D collision detection and finite elements model deformation were then applied to simulate nose augmentation surgery and predict postoperative appearance. According to the patient's expectation, digital models of the nose implants were constantly modified. When the patient is satisfied with the simulated results, custom made silicone implants were produced by a computer controlled device. Accurately regeneration of 3D images and realistic operative simulations could be achieved with this system. The implants produced exactly conformed to the results of simulation. No curving and reshaping were needed during operating. The clinical results extremely matched with the simulations. The system enhances surgeon patient communication and facilitates preoperative planning. It is especially desirable for implant surgery with less guesswork of size, contour, and orientation of the implant.

Modeling the forces of cutting with scissors,Mahvash M.; Voo L.M.; Kim D.; Jeung K.; Wainer J.; Okamura A.M.,2008,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2007.908069,"Modeling forces applied to scissors during cutting of biological materials is useful for surgical simulation. Previous approaches to haptic display of scissor cutting are based on recording and replaying measured data. This paper presents an analytical model based on the concepts of contact mechanics and fracture mechanics to calculate forces applied to scissors during cutting of a slab of material. The model considers the process of cutting as a sequence of deformation and fracture phases. During deformation phases, forces applied to the scissors are calculated from a torque-angle response model synthesized from measurement data multiplied by a ratio that depends on the position of the cutting crack edge and the curve of the blades. Using the principle of conservation of energy, the forces of fracture are related to the fracture toughness of the material and the geometry of the blades of the scissors. The forces applied to scissors generally include high-frequency fluctuations. We show that the analytical model accurately predicts the average applied force. The cutting model is computationally efficient, so it can be used for real-time computations such as haptic rendering. Experimental results from cutting samples of paper, plastic, cloth, and chicken skin confirm the model, and the model is rendered in a haptic virtual environment. © 2006 IEEE.",TRUE,Models scissor cutting forces but skips predicting or evaluating surgery aesthetics—out of scope.

Very little is known about the performance, in terms of the contact pressures and kinematics of TAR when subjected to daily activities such as level gait. For this purpose, an explicit finite element model of a novel 3-component TAR was developed, which incorporated a previously validated mechanical model of the ankle ligament apparatus. The intermediate mobile polyethylene meniscal bearing was modelled as an elastic-plastic continuum while the articulating surfaces of the tibial and talar metal components as rigid bodies. Overall kinematics, contact pressures and ligament forces were analysed during passive, i.e. virtually unloaded, and active, i.e. stance phase of gait, conditions. Simulation of passive motion predicted similar kinematics as reported previously in an analytical four-bar linkage model. The meniscal bearing was observed to move 5.6 mm posteriorly during the simulated stance and the corresponding antero-posterior displacement of the talar component was 8.3 mm. The predicted pattern and the amount (10.6°) of internal-external rotation of the ankle complex were found to be in good agreement with corresponding in vivo measurements on normal ankles. A peak contact pressure of 16.8 MPa was observed, with majority of contact pressures below 10 MPa. For most ligaments, reaction forces remain within corresponding physiological ranges. A first realistic representation of the biomechanical behaviour of the human ankle when replaced by prosthetic joints is provided.

Clinical studies are also underway to evaluate their performance in other deep tissue applications. However, little is known about their intrinsic mechanical behavior and their interactions with surrounding tissues. The primary objective of the current study was to analyze the mechanical behavior of barbed sutures using a finite element analysis approach. First, the effect of applying a point-pressure load to the tip of the barb and measuring its effect on barb displacement was studied. Second, the effect of an applied displacement to a barb anchored either in skin or tendon material for both the suture and the surrounding tissue. The results indicate that the flexibility of the barb can be increased or decreased by changing the barb geometry. It was concluded that the barb geometry and design need to be modified for use with different types of tissue. For example, in order to achieve the best mechanical anchoring with skin tissue the barb should be more flexible compared to the one designed to work with tendon tissue.

How to qualify and validate wear simulation devices and methods,Heintze S.D.,2006,Dental Materials,10.1016/j.dental.2006.02.002,"The clinical significance of increased wear can mainly be attributed to impaired aesthetic appearance and/or functional restrictions. Little is known about the systemic effects of swallowed or inhaled worn particles that derive from restorations. As wear measurements in vivo are complicated and time-consuming, wear simulation devices and methods had been developed without, however, systematically looking at the factors that influence important wear parameters. Wear simulation devices shall simulate processes that occur in the oral cavity during mastication, namely force, force profile, contact time, sliding movement, clearance of worn material, etc. Different devices that use different force actuator principles are available. Those with the highest citation frequency in the literature are - in descending order - the Alabama, ACTA, OHSU, Zurich and MTS wear simulators. When following the FDA guidelines on good laboratory practice (GLP) only the expensive MTS wear simulator is a qualified machine to test wear in vitro; the force exerted by the hydraulic actuator is controlled and regulated during all movements of the stylus. All the other simulators lack control and regulation of force development during dynamic loading of the flat specimens. This may be an explanation for the high coefficient of variation of the results in some wear simulators (28-40%) and the poor reproducibility of wear results if dental databases are searched for wear results of specific dental materials (difference of 22-72% for the same material). As most of the machines are not qualifiable, wear methods applying the machine may have a sound concept but cannot be validated. Only with the MTS method have wear parameters and influencing factors been documented and verified. A good compromise with regard to costs, practicability and robustness is the Willytec chewing simulator, which uses weights as force actuator and step motors for vertical and lateral movements. The Ivoclar wear method run on the Willytec machine shows a mean coefficient of variation in vertical wear of 12%. Force measurements have revealed that in the beginning of the stylus/specimen contact phase the force impulse is 3-4 times higher during dynamic loading than during static loading. When correlating material properties to the wear results of 23 composite resins subjected to the Ivoclar method, some parameters could be identified and incorporated into a wear formula to predict wear with the Ivoclar method. A round robin test evaluating the wear of ten dental materials with five wear simulation methods showed that the results were not comparable, as all methods follow different wear testing concepts. All wear methods lack the evidence of their clinical relevance because prospective studies correlating in vitro with long-term in vivo results with identical materials are not available. For direct restorative materials, amalgam seems to be a realistic reference material. For indirect, namely crown and bridge materials, low strength ceramic is appropriate. © 2006 Academy of Dental Materials.",FALSE,

CT scans of each patient were taken at pre- and post-operative states. Each scan was registered to a universal 3D coordinate system defined by cephalometric landmarks. A grid, parallel to the coronal plane, was also designed for the comparison of the changes. The bone and soft tissue was intersected by the projected line from each point on the grid. The coordinate values of intersected point were measured and compared between the pre- and post-operative models. In addition, the reproducibility of the universal coordinate system and the grid was evaluated. The facial surface changes after setback surgery occurred not only in the mandible but also in the mouth corner region. The soft tissue changes of the mandible were measured relatively by the proportional ratios to the bone changes. The ratios at the mid-sagittal plane were 77-102% (p < 0.05). The ratios at all other sagittal planes had similar patterns to the mid-sagittal plane with decreased values. All the results conformed to the previous 2D based clinical knowledge and instinct of orthodontists. It is expected that the proposed approach would be applicable to other oral and maxillofacial surgeries as well as plastic surgeries. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",FALSE,
Applications of machine learning in facial cosmetic surgeries: a scoping review,"Ahmadi, Nima and Niazmand, Maral and Ghasemi, Ali and Mohaghegh, Sadra and Motamedian, Saeed Reza",2023,Aesthetic Plastic Surgery,Springer,"Background: Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly applied in various medical fields, including facial cosmetic surgeries, to enhance diagnostic accuracy, surgical planning, and outcome prediction. This scoping review aims to systematically map the existing literature on the applications of ML in facial cosmetic surgeries, identify current trends, and highlight potential areas for future research.  Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases to identify studies employing ML techniques in facial cosmetic surgery contexts. Studies were screened and selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted regarding the types of ML algorithms used, surgical applications, outcomes measured, and study designs.  Results: The review included studies focusing on preoperative assessment, surgical simulation, postoperative outcome prediction, and complication risk stratification using ML models. Commonly used algorithms included convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests. Applications ranged from facial feature analysis and aesthetic outcome evaluation to personalized surgical planning. Despite promising results, challenges such as limited datasets, lack of standardization, and ethical considerations were noted.  Conclusions: ML holds significant potential to revolutionize facial cosmetic surgeries by improving precision and personalized care. However, further research with larger, diverse datasets and standardized methodologies is necessary to validate and integrate ML tools into clinical practice effectively.

Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis methods for determining ten causes of lengthening of a soft-tissue anterior cruciate ligament graft construct,Smith C.; Hull M.L.; Howell S.M.,2008,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.2904897,"There are many causes of lengthening of an anterior cruciate ligament soft-tissue graft construct (i.e., graft + fixation devices + bone), which can lead to an increase in anterior laxity. These causes can be due to plastic deformation and/or an increase in elastic deformation. The purposes of this in vitro study were (1) to develop the methods to quantify eight causes (four elastic and four plastic) associated with the tibial and femoral fixations using Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) and to demonstrate the usefulness of these methods, (2) to assess how well an empirical relationship between an increase in length of the graft construct and an increase in anterior laxity predicts two causes (one elastic and one plastic) associated with the graft midsubstance, and (3) to determine the increase in anterior tare laxity (i.e., laxity under the application of a 30 N anterior tare force) before the graft force reaches zero. Markers were injected into the tibia, femur, and graft in six cadaveric legs whose knees were reconstructed with single-loop tibialis grafts. To satisfy the first objective, legs were subjected to 1500 cycles at 1/4 Hz of 150 N anterior force transmitted at the knee. Based on marker 3D coordinates, equations were developed for determining eight causes associated with the fixations. After 1500 load cycles, plastic deformation between the graft and WasherLoc tibial fixation was the greatest cause with an average of 0.8±0.5 mm followed by plastic deformation between the graft and cross-pin-type femoral fixation with an average of 0.5±0.1 mm. The elastic deformations between the graft and tibial fixation and between the graft and femoral fixation decreased averages of 0.3±0.3 mm and 0.2±0.1 mm, respectively. The remaining four causes associated with the fixations were close to 0. To satisfy the remaining two objectives, after cyclic loading, the graft was lengthened incrementally while the 30 N anterior tare laxity, 150 N anterior laxity, and graft tension were measured. The one plastic cause and one elastic cause associated with the graft midsubstance were predicted by the empirical relationships with random errors (i.e., precision) of 0.9 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. The minimum increase in 30 N anterior tare laxity before the graft force reached zero was 5 mm. Hence, each of the eight causes of an increase in the 150 N anterior laxity associated with the fixations can be determined with RSA as long as the overall increase in the 30 N anterior tare laxity does not exceed 5 mm. However predicting the two causes associated with the graft using empirical relationships is prone to large errors. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.",FALSE,

Patient-specific RV/LV morphologies were acquired by using planar tagged MRI. The 3D RV/LV FSI model was solved using a commercial finite element package ADINA. Our results indicated that flow and stress/strain distributions in the right ventricle are closely related to RV morphology, material properties and blood pressure conditions.

Automated detection and segmentation of cylindrical fragments from calibrated C-arm images for long bone fracture reduction,Zheng G.; Dong X.; Grutzner P.A.; Nolte L.-P.,2007,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2007.03.002,"Long bone fracture belongs to one of the most common injuries encountered in clinical routine trauma surgery. Automated identification, pose and size estimation, and contour extraction of diaphyseal bone fragments can greatly improve the usability of a computer-assisted, fluoroscopy-based navigation system for long bone fracture reduction. In this paper, a two-step solution is proposed. In the first step, the pose and size of a diaphyseal fragment are estimated through a three-dimensional (3D) morphable object-based fitting process using a parametric cylinder model. This fitting process is optimally solved by a hybrid optimization technique coupling a random sample consensus (RANSAC) paradigm and an iterative closest point (ICP) matching procedure. Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the parameters for the RANSAC paradigm. The results of the fragment detection step are then fed to the second step, where a region information based active contour model is used to extract the fragment contours.

The influence of different layers on the mechanical properties was therefore also examined by comparing the relaxation strength and elastic and plastic strains for bone pellets impacted in one and two layers during constrained compression of human MCB. The relaxation strength was found to increase significantly by 14% for two layer pellets compared to one layer pellets, and the plastic strains decreased significantly by 15%, while the elastic strains were similar.

A haptics-assisted cranio-maxillofacial surgery planning system for restoring skeletal anatomy in complex trauma cases,Olsson P.; Nysjö F.; Hirsch J.-M.; Carlbom I.B.,2013,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-013-0827-5,"Purpose: Cranio-maxillofacial (CMF) surgery to restore normal skeletal anatomy in patients with serious trauma to the face can be both complex and time-consuming. But it is generally accepted that careful pre-operative planning leads to a better outcome with a higher degree of function and reduced morbidity in addition to reduced time in the operating room. However, today's surgery planning systems are primitive, relying mostly on the user's ability to plan complex tasks with a two-dimensional graphical interface. Methods: A system for planning the restoration of skeletal anatomy in facial trauma patients using a virtual model derived from patient-specific CT data. The system combines stereo visualization with six degrees-of-freedom, high-fidelity haptic feedback that enables analysis, planning, and preoperative testing of alternative solutions for restoring bone fragments to their proper positions. The stereo display provides accurate visual spatial perception, and the haptics system provides intuitive haptic feedback when bone fragments are in contact as well as six degrees-of-freedom attraction forces for precise bone fragment alignment. Results: A senior surgeon without prior experience of the system received 45 min of system training. Following the training session, he completed a virtual reconstruction in 22 min of a complex mandibular fracture with an adequately reduced result. Conclusion: Preliminary testing with one surgeon indicates that our surgery planning system, which combines stereo visualization with sophisticated haptics, has the potential to become a powerful tool for CMF surgery planning.

Analysis of thermal stress in cryosurgery of kidneys,He X.; Bischof J.C.,2005,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.1934021,"In this study, the thermal stress distribution in cryosurgery of kidney was investigated using a multiphysics finite element model developed in ANSYS (V8.1). The thermal portion of the model was verified using experimental data and the mechanics portion of the model (elastic) was verified using classic analytical solutions. Temperature dependent thermal and mechanical properties were used in the model. Moreover, the model accounts for thermal expansion due to both thermal expansion in single phase and volumetric expansion associated with phase change of tissue water to ice. For a clinical cylindrical cryoprobe inserted into the renal cortex from the top-middle renal capsule, it was found that the thermal stress distributions along the radial position are very different at different depths from the top renal capsule. The thermal stress is much higher at both ends than in the middle of the cryoprobe surface. It was found that there might be more tissue next to the top renal capsule than other region undergoing microcrack formation or plastic deformation. Furthermore, it was found that macrocrack formation is more likely to occur in tissue adjacent to the cryoprobe surface (especially on the sharp point tip) and during the thawing phase of cryosurgery. It was further found that the volumetric expansion associated with phase change induced much higher thermal stress than thermal expansion in a single phase and might therefore be the main cause of the frequently observed crack formation shortly after initiation of thawing in cryosurgery. Because the thermal stress adjacent to the cryoprobe is much higher than the yield stress of frozen renal tissue, a plastic stress model is required for better modeling of the thermal stress distribution in cryosurgery of kidney in future. However the computational effort will then be drastically increased due to the strong nonlinear nature of the plastic model and more experimental studies are indispensable for better understanding of the mechanical behavior of frozen tissue in cryosurgery.

The model incorporated a novel approach in implementing orthotropic and inhomogeneous bone properties and non-uniform distributed loading. Cortical, cancellous, and subchondral bone of the femur and the tibia were modeled. Mechanical properties for the cortical and cancellous bone were mapped from published data characterizing the anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the bone properties. Mesh adequacy was determined using stress convergence and strain energy error convergence. Qualitatively, the results of the study compare well with experimental principal compressive strains from the literature. With respect to tunnel placement in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the model predicted stress-shielding at the postero-lateral region of the tunnel wall, and increased stress at the postero-medial region of the tunnel wall. The stresses in the cancellous bone beneath the tunnel were, in general, lower than those above the tunnel. Prolonged stress shielding leads to bone resorption of the posterior tunnel wall leading to tunnel enlargement, and possible compromise of the ACL reconstruction. The stresses on the femoral cortex produced from a button-type fixation were noticeable for low levels of loading; the stress levels were very similar in models incorporating bone properties of patients aged 45 and 65. Repeated compression of the femoral cortex at these stress levels may cause microdamage to the cortex eventually resulting in fatigue failure. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

From this perspective, a method is proposed, based on a technique called the mesh-matching method, followed by a process that corrects mesh irregularities. The meshmatching algorithm generates patient-specific volume meshes from an existing generic model. The mesh regularization process is based on the Jacobian matrix transform related to the FE reference element and the current element. This method for generating patient-specific FE models is first applied to computer-assisted maxillofacial surgery, and more precisely, to the FE elastic modelling of patient facial soft tissues. For each patient, the planned bone osteotomies (mandible, maxilla, chin) are used as boundary conditions to deform the FE face model, in order to predict the aesthetic outcome of the surgery. Seven FE patientspecific models were successfully generated by our method. For one patient, the prediction of the FE model is qualitatively compared with the patient's post-operative appearance, measured from a computer tomography scan. Then, our methodology is applied to computer-assisted orbital surgery. It is, therefore, evaluated for the generation of 11 patient-specific FE poroelastic models of the orbital soft tissues. These models are used to predict the consequences of the surgical decompression of the orbit. More precisely, an average law is extrapolated from the simulations carried out for each patient model. This law links the size of the osteotomy (i.e. the surgical gesture) and the backward displacement of the eyeball (the consequence of the surgical gesture). © 2005 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",FALSE,

Optimization of rib surgery parameters for the correction of scoliotic deformities using approximation models,Carrier J.; Aubin C.-É.; Trochu F.; Labelle H.,2005,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.1933879,"Background. As opposed to thoracoplasty (a cosmetic surgical intervention used to reduce the rib hump associated with scoliosis), experimental scoliosis has been produced or reversed on animals by rib shortening or lengthening. In a prior work (J. Orthop. Res., 20, pp. 1121-1128), a finite element modeling (FEM) of rib surgeries was developed to study the biomechanics of their correction mechanisms. Our aims in the present study were to investigate the influence of the rib surgery parameters and to identify optimal configurations. Hence, a specific objective of this study was to develop a method to find surgical parameters maximizing the correction by addressing the issue of high computational cost associated with FEM. Method of Approach. Different configurations of rib shortening or lengthening were simulated using a FEM of the complete torso adapted to the geometry of six patients. Each configuration was assessed using objective functions that represent different correction objectives. Their value was evaluated using the rib surgery simulation for sample locations in the design space specified by an experimental design. Dual kriging (interpolation technique) was used to fit the data from the computer experiment. The resulting approximation model was used to locate parameters minimizing the objective function. Results. The overall coverage of the design space and the use of an approximation model ensured that the optimization algorithm had not found a local minimum but a global optimal correction. The interventions generally produced slight immediate modifications with final geometry presenting between 95-120% of the initial deformation in about 50% of the tested cases. But in optimal cases, important loads (500-2000 N mm) were generated on vertebral endplates in the apical region, which could potentially produce the long-term correction of vertebral wedging by modulating growth. Optimal parameters varied among patients and for different correction objectives. Conclusions. Approximation models make it possible to study and find optimal rib surgery parameters while reducing computational cost. Copyright © 2005 by ASME.",FALSE,

Modeling the thermal response of porcine cartilage to laser irradiation,Diaz S.H.; Aguilar G.; Lavernia E.J.; Wong B.J.F.,2001,IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,10.1109/2944.983298,"During laser irradiation of biological tissue, a number of physical processes take place that determine temperature elevation and thermal damage rates.

The aim of this study was to formulate a finite-element model (FEM) able to predict the temperature distribution in a slab of porcine nasal cartilage during laser irradiation. The FEM incorporates heat diffusion, light propagation in tissue, and water evaporation from the surfaces of the slab. Numerical results were compared to experimental temperature distributions where surface and internal temperatures were measured while heating cartilage using a pulsed Nd : YAG laser (λ = 1.32 μm).

While the exact mechanism by which IH initiates and proliferates has yet to be fully elucidated, it is clear that the abnormal haemodynamics present in the downstream graft/artery junction are intrinsic in its development. Mass transport disturbances owing to abnormal haemodynamics have been associated with atherogenesis and it is for this reason that an investigation into transport of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a known promoter of the intimal hyperplastic response, at the downstream graft/artery junction was carried out. A steady flow analysis in a three-dimensional, idealized, downstream graft/artery junction was carried out using commercial computational fluid dynamics software. It was found that there is a two-and-half fold increase in the transport of PDGF to the artery wall at the bed of the junction when compared with an idealized, healthy artery. The presence of secondary flows in the downstream arterial section also leads to large disturbances in mass transport. It was concluded that PDGF transport in the downstream graft/artery junction tends to be highly disturbed and that there may be a role of this disturbance in the initiation and subsequent development of distal anastornotic intimal hyperplasia. © IMechE 2005.",FALSE,

Results from computations were compared with those from a laboratory experiment in terms of radial expansion and elastic recoil. By means of a scanning electronic microscopy the area of plastic deformation were also detected and compared with those obtained in the numerical simulation.

The method presented in this paper provides accurate 3-D patient registration for correction of these movement errors during data acquisition and active patient referencing to update the position of the head during surgery. Experimental data concerning the accuracy of repeated positionings of our patient registration and reference system demonstrated a high degree of accuracy with mean spatial errors of 0.82 mm ± 0.31 mm in a plastic skull and 1.56 ± 0.76 mm in patients, respectively.

To meet these two demands, an analytical solution to the problem of guide wire motion has been derived, using a new parametrisation of guide wire shape. The algorithm is highly generic, is entirely based on elementary physics and has good convergence properties (accuracy of 22 micron after two iterations). In an experimental validation of the algorithm in a planar model, the RMS of the spatial discrepancy between the real and simulated catheter positions was about 10% of the lumen size.

Computer supported pre-operative simulation of neonatus cranial bone bending in craniosynostosis surgery planning,Clijmans T.; Mommaerts M.; Suetens P.; Vander Sloten J.,2006,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-006-0024-x,"Craniosynostosis refers to a category of skull malformations caused by premature fusion of one or more sutures in the cranial vault. Frequently, during skull reconstruction surgery, pieces of bone, which have been taken out of the skull, need to be deformed within the plastic region before replacement. Since existing surgery planning software does not allow bone bending simulation, the surgeon relies on his experience to determine the correct curvature and to make sure the bone will not fracture. Therefore, there are two important aspects to the bending algorithm presented in this paper: the visualization and the fracture risk assessment. The Matlab® visualization method allows simulating bending of an STL modeled bone segment, obtained from simulation in commercial planning software, in a realistic way. The estimation of the fracture risk is a valuable addition to the simulation environment as the user is informed about the feasibility of his bending actions. The bone bending algorithm has been successfully applied in two clinical cases of skull reconstruction planning for craniosynostosis surgery.

Computer-based planning of optimal donor sites for autologous osseous grafts,Król Z.; Chlebiej M.; Zerfass P.; Zeilhofer H.-F.; Sader R.; Mikołajczak P.; Keeve E.,2002,Proceedings of SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1117/12.466916,"Bone graft surgery is often necessary for reconstruction of craniofacial defects after trauma, tumor, infection or congenital malformation. In this operative technique the removed or missing bone segment is filled with a bone graft. The mainstay of the craniofacial reconstruction rests with the replacement of the defected bone by autogeneous bone grafts. To achieve sufficient incorporation of the autograft into the host bone, precise planning and simulation of the surgical intervention is required. The major problem is to determine as accurately as possible the donor site where the graft should be dissected from and to define the shape of the desired transplant. A computer-aided method for semi-automatic selection of optimal donor sites for autografts in craniofacial reconstructive surgery has been developed. The non-automatic step of graft design and constraint setting is followed by a fully automatic procedure to find the best fitting position. In extension to preceding work, a new optimization approach based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method has been implemented and embedded into our computer-based surgical planning system. This new technique enables, once the pre-processing step has been performed, selection of the optimal donor site in time less than one minute. The method has been applied during surgery planning step in more than 20 cases. The postoperative observations have shown that functional results, such as speech and chewing ability as well as restoration of bony continuity were clearly better compared to conventionally planned operations.

However, intimal hyperplasia (IH) and re-stenosis often occur after surgery leading to serious clinical problems. A multi-physics computational model with tube wall growth and fluid-structure interactions and an iterative mixed method using finite volume, generalized finite difference and finite elements are introduced to simulate focal intimal hyperplasia and blood flow in rat abdominal artery with a vein graft. Physical parameters and physiological geometries from in vivo experimental data are used in model development and verifications. Our results indicate that the mismatches in geometry and mechanical properties between the host artery and the vein graft cause considerable disturbance in flow shear stress, eddy flow, tube wall deformation, and tensile stress/strain distributions. Focal intimal hyperplasia and re-stenosis process are closely related to eddy flow and low and oscillating shear stresses. A constitutive growth function which governs the IH growth is quantified based on experimental data and computational simulations. Further investigation of effects of other factors such as tensile stress and various cell interactions is needed to fully understand IH growth and re-stenosis process. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A common symptom of the chronic stage is penile deformity during erection, which is frequently associated with pain and erectile dysfunction. A two-dimensional biomechanical model of the penis was applied to study the development of Peyronie's disease by simulating the mechanical stress distribution which would result from the interaction of the ossified tunical tissue with other penile soft tissues. The model was solved by using commercial finite element software for a characteristic erectile pressure. The results demonstrate that Peyronie's plaques may induce intensified stresses around the penile nerves and blood vessels, up to double those in the normal penis. These elevated stresses may cause a painful sensation of neural origin or ischemia in regions of compressed vascular tissue. Severe penile deformities have been shown to develop if Peyronie's plaques develop only around one of the corpora cavernosa due to the non-homogeneous resistance of the tunica to expansion during erection.

In such cases, there is a need to approximate information present in the original subject that is not reflected in contiguously acquired MR images because of hardware sampling limitations. In the context of vascular morphology reconstruction, this information is required in order for subsequent visualization and computational analysis of blood vessels to be most effective. Toward that end we have developed a method of vascular morphology reconstruction based on adaptive control grid interpolation (ACGI) to function as a precursor to visualization and computational analysis. ACGI has previously been implemented in addressing various problems including video coding and tracking. This paper focuses on the novel application of the technique to medical image processing. ACGI combines features of optical flow-based and block-based motion estimation algorithms to enhance insufficiently dense MR data sets accurately with a minimal degree of computational complexity. The resulting enhanced data sets describe vascular geometries. These reconstructions can then be used as visualization tools and in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to offer the pressure and velocity information necessary to quantify power loss.

Calcium phosphate nucleation on surface-modified PTFE membranes,Grøndahl L.; Cardona F.; Chiem K.; Wentrup-Byrne E.; Bostrom T.,2003,Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine,10.1023/A:1023403929496,"Highly porous PTFE membranes are currently being used in facial reconstructive surgery. The present study aims at improving this biomaterial through creating a more bioactive surface by introducing ionic groups onto the surface. The unmodified PTFE membrane does not induce inorganic growth after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) for up to 4 weeks. Copolymeric grafting with acrylic acid (AAc) by means of gamma irradiation and subsequent in vitro testing in SBF reveals that this copolymer initially acts as an ion-exchange material and subsequently induces growth of a calcium phosphate phase (Ca/P=2.7) when large amounts (15%) of pAAc are introduced onto the membrane surface. This copolymer is not expected to function well from a biomaterials perspective since SEM showed the pores on the surface to be partly blocked. In contrast, the surface of monoacryloxyethyl phosphate (MAEP)-modified samples is altered at a molecular level only.

Computer aided osteotomy design for harvesting autologous bone grafts in reconstructive surgery,Kro�l Z.; Zerfass P.; Von Rymon-Lipinski B.; Jansen T.; Hauck W.; Zeilhofer H.-F.; Sader R.; Keeve E.,2001,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1117/12.428062,"Autologous grafts serve as the standard grafting material in the treatment of maxillofacial bone tumors, traumatic defects or congenital malformations. The pre-selection of a donor site depends primarily on the morphological fit of the available bone mass and the shape of the part that has to be transplanted. To achieve sufficient incorporation of the autograft into the host bone, precise planning and simulation of the surgical intervention based on three-dimensional CT studies is required. This paper presents a method to identify an optimal donor site by performing an optimization of appropriate similarity measures between donor region and a given transplant. At the initial stage the surgeon has to delineate the osteotomy border lines in the template CT data set and to define a set of constraints for the optimization task in the donor site CT data set. The following fully automatic optimization stage delivers a set of sub-optimal and optimal donor sites for a given template. All generated solutions can be explored interactively on the computer display using an efficient graphical interface. Reconstructive operations supported by our system were performed on 28 patients. We found that the operation time can be considerably shortened by this approach.",TRUE,"Focuses on surgical planning, not on predicting or evaluating aesthetics."

A statistical wisp model and pseudophysical approaches for interactive hairstyle generation,Choe B.; Ko H.-S.,2005,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,10.1109/TVCG.2005.20,"This paper presents an interactive technique that produces static hairstyles by generating individual hair strands of the desired shape and color, subject to the presence of gravity and collisions. A variety of hairstyles can be generated by adjusting the wisp parameters, while the deformation is solved efficiently, accounting for the effects of gravity and collisions. Wisps are generated employing statistical approaches. As for hair deformation, we propose a method which is based on physical simulation concepts, but is simplified to efficiently solve the static shape of hair. On top of the statistical wisp model and the deformation solver, a constraint-based styler is proposed to model artificial features that oppose the natural flow of hair under gravity and hair elasticity, such as a hairpin.

The considered system is composed of a fixture, an abutment and a connecting screw. We analysed the behaviour of the implant system considering three different designs of the fixture, in order to establish which one provides the better mechanical behaviour. After the definition of the numerical models, loading conditions were selected in order to reproduce the same stress state found in previous mechanical failure tests. Preloading and functional loading conditions were simulated. The analysis of the numerical results shows that the structure yielding is due to the fixture neck plastic deformation, that increases the load eccentricity and then the bending stress on the connecting screw. Only slight differences were found between the three implant systems in the amount and distribution of stress. The model reproduces properly the implant systems and the experimental set-up. The goodness of the model can be summarised as: realistic geometrical structure, elastoplastic model for the material description, correct definition of the contacts and the existing tolerance among the different system components, reproduction of the preloading stress condition.

The results showed that the mechanical cutting method could produce barbs with precise geometry and good surface quality. The barb geometry significantly influenced the tensile strength, barb pull-out force, and tissue holding capacity of the sutures. Sutures with longer barb length and smaller barb angle exhibited higher tissue holding capacity but reduced tensile strength. The optimized barb geometry achieved a balance between mechanical strength and tissue anchoring ability.

However, the effect of heterogeneous hydrogels on neuronal differentiation of bone marrow derived stromal cells (BMSCs) remains unclear. Herein, a heterogeneous poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) (pHPMA) hydrogel was fabricated by combining two pHPMA hydrogels with different stiffnesses. The heterogeneous pHPMA hydrogel exhibited a gradient stiffness from 0.5 to 15 kPa, mimicking the mechanical heterogeneity of native neural tissue. BMSCs cultured on the heterogeneous hydrogel showed enhanced neuronal differentiation compared to those on homogeneous hydrogels, as evidenced by increased expression of neuronal markers βIII-tubulin and MAP2. In vivo implantation of BMSCs-laden heterogeneous hydrogel into a rat spinal cord injury model promoted neuronal differentiation and improved functional recovery.

Effects of the learning curve on operative time and lymph node harvesting during robotic gastrectomy,Staderini F.; Barbato G.; Bottari A.; Russo E.; Fortuna L.; Giudici F.; Coratti F.; Stacchini L.; Indennitate G.; Cianchi F.,2023,International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,"Abstract  The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the learning curve on operative time and lymph node harvesting during robotic gastrectomy. We retrospectively reviewed 100 consecutive patients who underwent robotic gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The learning curve was analyzed using the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method based on operative time. Patients were divided into two groups: the early phase (cases 1–40) and the late phase (cases 41–100). We compared operative time, number of harvested lymph nodes, and perioperative outcomes between the two groups. The CUSUM analysis showed a significant reduction in operative time after 40 cases. The mean operative time was significantly shorter in the late phase group compared to the early phase group (210 ± 35 minutes vs. 270 ± 40 minutes, p < 0.001). The number of harvested lymph nodes was significantly higher in the late phase group (35 ± 8 vs. 28 ± 7, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in perioperative complications between the two groups. In conclusion, the learning curve for robotic gastrectomy affects operative time and lymph node harvesting, with improvements observed after 40 cases. These findings suggest that surgical proficiency in robotic gastrectomy can be achieved with experience, leading to more efficient surgery and improved oncological outcomes.",FALSE,

However, the registration of the fibula, which is the donor bone, remains challenging due to its complex shape and limited anatomical landmarks. This study proposes a hybrid registration method combining surface and landmark-based approaches to improve the accuracy and robustness of fibula registration for EM-navigated osteotomies. Methods A phantom model of the fibula was used to simulate the registration process. The hybrid method involved initial landmark-based registration using fiducial markers followed by surface-based refinement using iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The accuracy of the hybrid registration was compared to landmark-only and surface-only methods by measuring the target registration error (TRE) at predefined points. Results The hybrid registration method achieved a significantly lower mean TRE (1.2 ± 0.3 mm) compared to landmark-only (2.5 ± 0.7 mm) and surface-only (1.8 ± 0.5 mm) methods (p < 0.01). The hybrid approach also demonstrated improved robustness against noise and partial surface data. Conclusion The proposed hybrid registration method enhances the accuracy and reliability of fibula registration for EM-navigated mandibular reconstructive surgery.

However, the standard port placement often results in visible scars on the abdomen, which some patients find undesirable. This study presents the first case series of robotic-assisted hysterectomy performed with a novel ‘diamond’ port placement below the bikini line using the Hugo™ RAS system, aiming to improve cosmetic outcomes without compromising surgical efficacy.  Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective case series involving patients undergoing robotic-assisted hysterectomy for benign gynecological conditions. The ‘diamond’ port placement was utilized, positioning all ports below the bikini line. Surgical outcomes, including operative time, blood loss, complications, and postoperative recovery, were recorded and analyzed.  Results: Five patients underwent robotic-assisted hysterectomy with the ‘diamond’ port placement. All procedures were completed successfully without conversion to open surgery. The mean operative time was 120 minutes, and estimated blood loss was minimal. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. Patients reported high satisfaction with the cosmetic results, noting the absence of visible abdominal scars.  Conclusion: The ‘diamond’ port placement below the bikini line using the Hugo™ RAS system is a feasible and safe approach for robotic-assisted hysterectomy. This technique offers excellent cosmetic outcomes while maintaining surgical effectiveness.

Three-dimensional photography for intraoperative morphometric analysis in metopic craniosynostosis surgery,García-Mato D.; García-Sevilla M.; Porras A.R.; Ochandiano S.; Darriba-Allés J.V.; García-Leal R.; Salmerón J.I.; Linguraru M.G.; Pascau J.,2021,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"Purpose: Metopic craniosynostosis (MC) is a common form of craniosynostosis characterized by premature fusion of the metopic suture resulting in trigonocephaly. Surgical correction aims to restore normal cranial shape and volume. Traditional morphometric analysis relies on two-dimensional imaging, which may not fully capture the complex three-dimensional (3D) cranial deformities. This study evaluates the feasibility and accuracy of intraoperative 3D photography for morphometric analysis during MC surgery.  Methods: We conducted a prospective study involving patients undergoing surgical correction for MC. Intraoperative 3D photographs were acquired using a handheld 3D imaging system at multiple surgical stages. Morphometric parameters including cranial vault volume, interorbital distance, and frontal width were measured from 3D images and compared with preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans and postoperative outcomes.  Results: Intraoperative 3D photography provided high-resolution images enabling precise morphometric measurements. The 3D measurements correlated strongly with CT-based measurements (r > 0.9, p < 0.001). Intraoperative imaging allowed real-time assessment of cranial shape changes, facilitating surgical decision-making. The technique was non-invasive, rapid, and did not interfere with the surgical workflow.  Conclusion: Intraoperative 3D photography is a valuable tool for morphometric analysis in MC surgery, offering accurate, real-time assessment of cranial morphology. This approach enhances surgical precision and may improve aesthetic and functional outcomes in patients with metopic craniosynostosis.

Assessment of human adipose-derived stem cell on surface-modified silicone implant to reduce capsular contracture formation,Sutthiwanjampa C.; Shin B.H.; Ryu N.E.; Kang S.H.; Heo C.Y.; Park H.,2022,Bioengineering and Translational Medicine,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"Capsular contracture is a common complication after silicone implant-based breast reconstruction. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) have been reported to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of hASCs on surface-modified silicone implants to reduce capsular contracture formation. We modified the surface of silicone implants with polydopamine (PDA) and immobilized hASCs on the PDA-coated surface. The hASC-immobilized implants were implanted subcutaneously in rats, and the formation of capsular contracture was assessed. Our results showed that the hASC-immobilized implants significantly reduced capsule thickness and collagen density compared to unmodified implants. Moreover, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and myofibroblast markers was decreased in the hASC group. These findings suggest that hASC immobilization on surface-modified silicone implants can effectively reduce capsular contracture formation by modulating the inflammatory response and fibrotic processes. This approach may provide a promising strategy to improve the outcomes of silicone implant-based breast reconstruction.",FALSE,

A computational approach to relative aesthetics,"Gattupalli, Vijetha and Chandakkar, Parag S and Li, Baoxin",2016,,,"Aesthetics is a subjective concept and it is difficult to design a computational model which can measure the aesthetic quality of an image. In this work, we propose a novel approach to assess the relative aesthetics of two images. Instead of predicting the absolute aesthetic score of an image, our model learns to predict which image is more aesthetically pleasing in a pair. We design a deep convolutional neural network that takes a pair of images as input and outputs the probability of one image being more beautiful than the other. We train our model on a large dataset of image pairs with relative aesthetic labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods on the task of relative aesthetics prediction.",FALSE,

This study aimed to compare the biocompatibility and degradation of four biodegradable copolymeric BOS in a goat model over a four-year follow-up period. Forty-eight goats were randomly assigned to four groups, each receiving one type of BOS: poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), poly(L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(L-lactic acid-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLLA-PCL), and poly(L-lactic acid-co-trimethylene carbonate) (PLLA-TMC). Clinical, radiographic, histological, and molecular analyses were performed at 6, 12, 24, and 48 months post-implantation. Results showed that all BOS provided adequate fixation and gradually degraded without adverse tissue reactions. PLLA and PLLA-PCL exhibited slower degradation rates with sustained mechanical integrity, while PLGA and PLLA-TMC degraded faster but induced mild inflammatory responses during early degradation phases. Histological evaluation revealed progressive replacement of BOS by new bone tissue, with PLLA-PCL demonstrating superior osteoconductivity. Molecular assays indicated transient upregulation of inflammatory cytokines correlating with degradation stages. Overall, PLLA-PCL presented the best balance between biocompatibility, degradation rate, and osteointegration, suggesting its potential as an optimal BOS for maxillofacial applications.

Patient-specific MV diagnosis is essential for treatment planning and outcome prediction. However, current clinical diagnosis relies on qualitative assessment and lacks quantitative parameters that characterize MV morphology and function. This study aims to develop a novel method for MV flattening and parameter mapping to enable quantitative and patient-specific MV diagnosis.  Methods: We propose a computational framework that flattens the 3D MV geometry into a 2D parametric domain while preserving anatomical features. The method involves segmenting the MV from 3D echocardiographic images, reconstructing the 3D MV surface, and applying a flattening algorithm to map the surface onto a 2D plane. We then extract morphological and functional parameters from the flattened MV, such as leaflet area, annulus shape, and coaptation metrics. The framework is validated on synthetic and clinical datasets.  Results: The proposed flattening method successfully maps complex 3D MV geometries into 2D domains with minimal distortion, enabling intuitive visualization and quantitative analysis. Parameter mapping reveals significant differences in MV morphology between healthy and diseased valves.

Then, a semiautomatic neck curve reconstruction algorithm is applied, which involves initial manual selection of points on the neck region followed by an automatic curve fitting process. Morphological parameters based on the reconstructed neck curve are calculated and used for rupture risk assessment. Results The method was evaluated on a dataset of 50 IAs, demonstrating improved accuracy and reproducibility of neck curve reconstruction compared to manual delineation. The morphological parameters derived from the semiautomatic neck curve showed better discrimination between ruptured and unruptured IAs. Conclusion The proposed semiautomatic neck curve reconstruction method provides a reliable and consistent way to define the neck boundary of IAs, enhancing the morphological analysis for rupture risk assessment. This approach has the potential to assist clinicians in making more informed treatment decisions.",FALSE,

Infrared thermography (IRT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can detect skin temperature variations related to underlying blood flow. This study aims to develop and evaluate an automatic method for detecting perforator vessels using IRT.  Methods: We propose an image processing algorithm that analyzes dynamic infrared thermographic sequences acquired during a cooling and rewarming protocol. The algorithm detects hotspots corresponding to perforator vessels by analyzing temporal temperature changes and spatial features. The method was tested on a dataset of IRT sequences from patients undergoing reconstructive surgery.  Results: The automatic detection method successfully identified perforator vessels with high sensitivity and specificity. The detected hotspots corresponded well with clinically identified perforators and Doppler ultrasound findings. The approach demonstrated robustness to variations in patient skin type and environmental conditions.  Conclusion: The proposed automatic detection method using IRT provides a reliable, non-invasive tool for identifying perforator vessels in reconstructive surgery.

However, the interpretation of MRI/MRS data is challenging due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of prostate cancer. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-kernel graph embedding (MKGE) framework for the detection and Gleason grading of prostate cancer using MRI/MRS data. The MKGE method integrates multiple kernels derived from different imaging modalities and incorporates the spatial relationships among voxels through graph embedding. This approach effectively captures the complementary information from MRI and MRS and the intrinsic geometric structure of the data. Experimental results on a clinical dataset demonstrate that the proposed MKGE method outperforms traditional single-kernel and feature-based methods in both cancer detection and Gleason grading, indicating its potential for improving prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",FALSE,

The MPFL was reconstructed using the LK ligament prosthesis in 24 rabbits. The rabbits were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. Histological evaluation was performed to assess the tissue ingrowth and remodeling of the prosthesis. At 2 weeks, fibroblast infiltration and neovascularization were observed in the prosthesis. At 4 weeks, collagen fibers were aligned along the longitudinal axis of the prosthesis. At 8 and 12 weeks, the prosthesis was well incorporated with dense collagen fibers and fibroblasts, resembling native ligament tissue. These findings suggest that the LK ligament prosthesis can be effectively incorporated into host tissue and may be a useful graft for MPFL reconstruction.",FALSE,
Effect of filler porosity on the abrasion resistance of nanoporous silica gel/polymer composites,Luo J.; Lannutti J.J.; Seghi R.R.,1998,Dental Materials,Elsevier Inc.,"The effect of filler porosity on the abrasion resistance of nanoporous silica gel/polymer composites was investigated. Nanoporous silica gels with different porosities were incorporated into polymer matrices, and their abrasion resistance was evaluated. The results showed that the porosity of the filler significantly influenced the wear behavior of the composites. Higher porosity fillers led to increased abrasion resistance due to enhanced energy dissipation and improved filler-matrix interfacial bonding. These findings suggest that controlling filler porosity is a viable strategy to optimize the wear performance of polymer composites.",FALSE,

Biocompatibility and degradation of poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid)/calcium phosphate cement composites,Ruhé P.Q.; Hedberg E.L.; Padron N.T.; Spauwen P.H.M.; Jansen J.A.; Mikos A.G.,2005,Journal of Biomedical Materials Research - Part A,,"Biodegradable composites of poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and calcium phosphate cement (CPC) were prepared and evaluated for their biocompatibility and degradation behavior. The composites were fabricated by mixing CPC powder with PLGA solution, followed by setting and drying. In vitro degradation studies showed that the composites exhibited a controlled degradation rate, with the PLGA component degrading faster than the CPC matrix. Cytotoxicity tests using L929 fibroblast cells indicated good biocompatibility of the composites, with no significant cytotoxic effects observed. In vivo implantation in rabbit femoral defects demonstrated that the composites supported new bone formation and gradually degraded over time, with minimal inflammatory response. These results suggest that PLGA/CPC composites have potential as biodegradable bone graft materials with favorable biocompatibility and degradation characteristics.",FALSE,

This study evaluates the biomechanical and histological performance of a bioresorbable lumbar interbody fusion cage made from poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) (PLDLLA) in a sheep model. Twelve sheep underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion at L2-L3 with implantation of the bioresorbable cage filled with autologous bone graft. Biomechanical testing was performed at 3 and 6 months postoperatively to assess fusion stability, and histological analysis was conducted to evaluate new bone formation and implant resorption. Results demonstrated progressive implant degradation accompanied by new bone formation within and around the cage, leading to increased fusion stability over time. The bioresorbable cage provided sufficient initial mechanical support and was gradually replaced by bone, indicating its potential as a viable alternative to metallic cages for lumbar interbody fusion.",FALSE,

Non-decay type fast-setting calcium phosphate cement: Setting behaviour in calf serum and its tissue response,Miyamoto Y.; Ishikawa K.; Takechi M.; Yuasa M.; Kon M.; Nagayama M.; Asaoka K.,1996,Biomaterials,Elsevier Science Ltd,The setting behaviour of a non-decay type fast-setting calcium phosphate cement (CPC) was investigated in calf serum and its tissue response was evaluated in vivo. The cement was prepared by mixing tetracalcium phosphate and dicalcium phosphate anhydrous powders with a 2% sodium phosphate solution. The setting time of the cement in calf serum was significantly shorter than that in distilled water. The compressive strength of the cement set in calf serum was also higher than that set in distilled water. Histological examination after implantation in rat femurs showed that the cement was biocompatible and was gradually resorbed and replaced by new bone tissue. These results suggest that the non-decay type fast-setting CPC has potential for clinical applications as a bone substitute material.,TRUE,"Focuses on bone cement materials, not surgery outcome prediction."

This study proposes a regression model to predict the extent of breast shape deformation after BCS using preoperative imaging and clinical data. The model incorporates variables such as tumor size, location, breast volume, and surgical parameters to estimate postoperative breast shape changes. The predictive accuracy of the model was evaluated using a dataset of patients who underwent BCS, demonstrating its potential utility in surgical planning and patient counseling. The results suggest that the regression model can serve as a valuable tool for anticipating cosmetic outcomes and guiding surgical decisions to minimize breast deformity.",FALSE,
Histological and compositional evaluations of three types of calcium phosphate cements when implanted in subcutaneous tissue immediately after mixing,Miyamoto Y.; Ishikawa K.; Takechi M.; Taketomo T.; Yuasa T.; Nagayama M.; Suzuki K.,1999,Journal of Biomedical Materials Research,John Wiley & Sons Inc,"The histological and compositional evaluations of three types of calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) were performed after implantation in subcutaneous tissue of rats immediately after mixing. The three types of CPCs were: (1) a mixture of tetracalcium phosphate and dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (TTCP-DCPA), (2) a mixture of α-tricalcium phosphate and dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (α-TCP-DCPA), and (3) a mixture of α-tricalcium phosphate and calcium carbonate (α-TCP-CaCO3). The CPCs were implanted subcutaneously in rats for 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days. Histological examination showed that all CPCs were biocompatible and induced minimal inflammatory reactions. The TTCP-DCPA and α-TCP-DCPA cements gradually transformed into hydroxyapatite (HA) in vivo, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The α-TCP-CaCO3 cement showed a different transformation pattern, with the formation of a carbonated apatite phase. These results suggest that the composition of CPCs influences their in vivo behavior and transformation, which is important for their clinical applications in bone repair.",FALSE,
