Chemical-physical behavior of Hydroxyapatite: A modeling approach,Guerfi Z.; Kribaa O.K.; Djouama H.,2024,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2023.106229,"Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is a ceramic composed of calcium phosphate, frequently employed as a bone substitute material due to its biocompatibility and bioactivity. Over the past century, there has been substantial attention in fields such as orthopedics and plastic surgery. Remarkably, synthetic HAp exhibits properties akin to those found in natural bone and teeth. Computational theoretical chemistry focuses on numerically computing molecular electronic structures and interactions. As chemistry education evolves, it's imperative to acknowledge the increasing significance of computational tools in research. Density Functional Theory (DFT) stands out as the most widely adopted method in contemporary computational chemistry. In this study, we synthesized Hydroxyapatite (HAp) via the double decomposition method using synthetic sources. The synthesized materials underwent thorough characterization, including X-ray Diffraction (XRD), UV–visible spectroscopy, and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy under various conditions. Additionally, we performed quantum mechanical computations on the HAp molecule using density functional theory. Our results were then compared with experimental data. Our experimental findings highlight the successful synthesis of HAp, particularly under specific temperature conditions. Moreover, the quantum chemistry calculations exhibited excellent agreement with the experimental results, especially in terms of spectroscopic characterizations. © 2023",TRUE,"Focuses on the chemical and physical traits of hydroxyapatite, not on automatic prediction or assessment of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery."
"Vascular anastomoses, hemodynamics and hemorheology: Some general thoughts and open questions",Nemeth N.,2022,Series on Biomechanics,10.7546/SB.09.2022,"Safe and well-functioning vascular anastomoses are essential in the everyday practice of vascular surgery, heart surgery, transplantation surgery as well as in reconstructive procedures, including microsurgical approaches. Regeneration of artificial vascular anastomoses, especially the maturation of fistulas and venous grafts, is strongly influenced by the hemodynamic forces driven by the flow characteristics as well. Exploring the hemorheological and hemodynamic conditions thus is inevitable to understand better the physiology and pathophysiology of the regeneration of vascular anastomoses and graft implantations, as well as in other vascular surgical interventions. In this paper main aspects and findings of experimental surgical and microsurgical models are summarized, studying artificial arterio-venous fistulas, porto-caval shunts, and various grafts using in vivo measurements, hemorheological and hemodynamic investigations, as well as special 3D flow simulation studies on ex vivo vascular segments. © 2022, Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite.

SERV-CT: A disparity dataset from cone-beam CT for validation of endoscopic 3D reconstruction,Edwards P.J.E.; Psychogyios D.; Speidel S.; Maier-Hein L.; Stoyanov D.,2022,Medical Image Analysis,10.1016/j.media.2021.102302,"In computer vision, reference datasets from simulation and real outdoor scenes have been highly successful in promoting algorithmic development in stereo reconstruction. Endoscopic stereo reconstruction for surgical scenes gives rise to specific problems, including the lack of clear corner features, highly specular surface properties and the presence of blood and smoke. These issues present difficulties for both stereo reconstruction itself and also for standardised dataset production. Previous datasets have been produced using computed tomography (CT) or structured light reconstruction on phantom or ex vivo models. We present a stereo-endoscopic reconstruction validation dataset based on cone-beam CT (SERV-CT). Two ex vivo small porcine full torso cadavers were placed within the view of the endoscope with both the endoscope and target anatomy visible in the CT scan. Subsequent orientation of the endoscope was manually aligned to match the stereoscopic view and benchmark disparities, depths and occlusions are calculated. The requirement of a CT scan limited the number of stereo pairs to 8 from each ex vivo sample. For the second sample an RGB surface was acquired to aid alignment of smooth, featureless surfaces. Repeated manual alignments showed an RMS disparity accuracy of around 2 pixels and a depth accuracy of about 2 mm. A simplified reference dataset is provided consisting of endoscope image pairs with corresponding calibration, disparities, depths and occlusions covering the majority of the endoscopic image and a range of tissue types, including smooth specular surfaces, as well as significant variation of depth. We assessed the performance of various stereo algorithms from online available repositories. There is a significant variation between algorithms, highlighting some of the challenges of surgical endoscopic images. The SERV-CT dataset provides an easy to use stereoscopic validation for surgical applications with smooth reference disparities and depths covering the majority of the endoscopic image.

A method for assessing guide layout and error on implant accuracy,Xu L.; Tian X.; Wu J.,2024,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108824,"Functional and esthetic results require accurate implant placement. We aimed to develop a predictive method for assessing guide layout and error on implant accuracy. A mathematical model for position error analysis was constructed based on triangular mesh data. This model examines the relationship between the spatial shifts of multiple surfaces and the spatial shifts of specific points. It involves encasing these surfaces in a cuboid bounding box and expressing them in a local coordinate system. The influence of positioning surface error and layout of surgical guide were researched with a simulation test. The result shows that error in the implant site position is directly related to the error in the guide locating surface under the same layout. When the guide locating surface layout varies, as the length, width, and height of the minimum cuboid envelope increase, the maximum deviation in the implant site position decreases. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Centers on implant placement accuracy and doesn't cover automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results, so it doesn't fit the review's focus on assessing aesthetics in plastic and cancer-related surgeries."
A novel microsurgery robot mechanism with mechanical motion scalability for intraocular and reconstructive surgery,Yang U.-J.; Kim D.; Hwang M.; Kong D.; Kim J.; Nho Y.-H.; Lee W.; Kwon D.-S.,2021,International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery,10.1002/rcs.2240,"Background: Intraocular surgery and reconstructive surgery are challenging microsurgery procedures that require two types of motion: precise motion and larger motion. To effectively perform the requisite motion using a robot, it is necessary to develop a manipulator that can adjust the scale of motion between precise motion and less precise, yet larger motion. Aims: In this paper, we propose a novel microsurgery robot using the dual delta structure (DDS) to mechanically scale the motion to seamlessly adjust between precise and larger motion. Materials & Methods: The DDS forms a lever mechanism that enables the motion scaling at the end-effector using two delta platforms. Seamless scale adjustment enables the robot to effectively perform various surgical moves. Results: A prototype robot system was developed to validate the effectiveness of the DDS.

Manufacturing of customized implants for orbital fractures using 3D printing,A M.; Mohan A A.; Reddy M H.,2021,Bioprinting,10.1016/j.bprint.2020.e00118,"An orbital fracture is a traumatic injury to the bone in the eye socket. These fractures modify the orbital bone dimensions and the functioning of the intraorbital contents. In this study, a surgical method that includes positioning, aligning and fixing implants to restore orbital fractures was adapted. Notably, it is difficult to achieve an original three-dimensional orbital shape through the process of forming and cutting implants; however, this problem was solved by creating customized implants using computed tomography (CT) images of the patient. The objective of this work is to reconstruct the damaged orbital floor defects by means of a 3D printed implant and restore the orbital floor to its original shape. A case study of an orbital fracture has been included in this study. CT images were used to create a computer-aided design (CAD) model of orbital floor implants, which were designed to maintain orbital floor symmetry from right to left and vice versa. Furthermore, the designed implants were manufactured through a material extrusion process with biocompatible material.

Optimization of grinding parameters in robotic-assisted preparation of cracked teeth based on fracture mechanics: FEA and experiment,Sun J.; Jiang J.; Ma B.; Zhang Y.; Pan J.; Qiao D.,2025,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108485,"Background and Objectives: If left untreated, cracked teeth can lead to tooth loss, of which the incidence is 70%. Dental preparation is an effective treatment, but it is difficult to meet the clinical requirements when traditionally prepared by dentists. Grinding-based tooth preparation robot (TPR) shows promise for clinical applications to assist dentists. However, current TPR has problems with chipping and crack extension when preparing real teeth. Methods: We propose a grinding parameter optimization strategy to solve this problem, specifically including preparation depth and direction. Among them, surface morphology observation technology and thermal-mechanical coupling simulation technology are used. Through theoretical modeling, computer simulation techniques and surface morphology experimental studies, different motion parameters are compared and analyzed to derive the optimal preparation parameters. Results: One of our contributions is to control the preparation depth based on the different material removal methods, and the brittle removal methods and grinding heat during the preparation process were reduced. Another contribution is to derive the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip for different preparation directions based on multi-grit and thermal-mechanical coupling finite element model for different preparation stages. The preparation direction was directed and crack extension was minimized. Finally, the experimental system of the TPR was constructed. Based on the proposed morphology and preparation direction optimization method, the material removal method during the preparation process can be controlled in plastic removal. Crack extension was also reduced based on different stages of optimized preparation directions. Based on the guided strategy, the TPR can provide safe assisted dentists. Conclusions: In this work, the preparation parameters of the cracked preparation robot were optimized to enable it to perform the preparation of hard and brittle cracked teeth.

In this context, the study of the interaction between the needle and the brain tissue is an important task. One of common ways to perform experimental study of such interaction is through the use brain phantoms. In this work, a series of experiments is performed on indentation of a biopsy needle into a phantom manufactured of the agar gel. During these experiments, the force of interaction between the needle and the phantom tissue was measured for different indentation speeds and depths. An analytical mathematical model is proposed that describes this force. The model takes into account such effects as viscoelastic and plastic properties and relaxation behavior of the material, as well as the presence of a surface film.

Temperature Field Prediction of Variable Bone Milling Conditions Based on Thermal-Parameter Calibration and Finite-Element Simulation,Zhou Z.; Hu J.; Dai Y.; Zhang J.; Jiang Z.,2025,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,10.1109/TIM.2025.3554280,"Bone milling is a common surgical procedure widely used in dental, orthopedic, and plastic surgeries. Bone has low thermal conductivity and high specific heat. As a result, significant heat generated during bone milling tends to accumulate in the milling area, often leading to thermal necrosis. Currently, there are no suitable sensors available to monitor the temperature during bone milling, which forces surgeons to rely on their personal experience to determine if the temperature is too high. This article presented a temperature field prediction model for robot-assisted bone milling using finite-element techniques. This model can predict the temperature distribution under various milling conditions, providing a valuable reference for surgeons. In developing this model, the thermal parameters of the cortical bone and the convective heat transfer coefficient of the environment were unknown. In order to determine these parameters, a heat conduction experiment based on a point heat source was designed. The identified parameters were then used to build the temperature prediction model. Five sets of dry milling experiments with different milling angles and depths and one set of experiments with irrigation fluid added were performed using a 4-DOF robot to verify the model.

This study aimed to create a machine-learning prediction model for 30-day mortality after a non-cardiac surgery that adapts to the manageable amount of clinical information as input features and is validated against multi-centered rather than single-centered data. Data were collected from 454,404 patients over 18 years of age who underwent non-cardiac surgeries from four independent institutions. We performed a retrospective analysis of the retrieved data. Only 12–18 clinical variables were used for model training. Logistic regression, random forest classifier, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural network methods were applied to compare the prediction performances. To reduce overfitting and create a robust model, bootstrapping and grid search with tenfold cross-validation were performed.

Computational modeling of vascular growth in patient-specific pulmonary arterial patch reconstructions,Lashkarinia S.S.; Coban G.; Kose B.; Salihoglu E.; Pekkan K.,2021,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110274,"Recent progress in vascular growth mechanics has involved the use of computational algorithms to address clinical problems with the use of three-dimensional patient specific geometries. The objective of this study is to establish a predictive computational model for the volumetric growth of pulmonary arterial (PA) tissue following complex cardiovascular patch reconstructive surgeries for congenital heart disease patients. For the first time in the literature, the growth mechanics and performance of artificial cardiovascular patches in contact with the growing PA tissue domain is established. An elastic-growing material model was developed in the open source FEBio software suite to first examine the surgical patch reconstruction process for an idealized main PA anatomy as a benchmark model and then for the patient-specific PA of a newborn. Following patch reconstruction, high levels of stress and strain are compensated by growth on the arterial tissue. As this growth progresses, the arterial tissue is predicted to stiffen to limit elastic deformations. We simulated this arterial growth up to the age of 18 years, when somatic growth plateaus. Our research findings show that the non-growing patch material remains in a low strain state throughout the simulation timeline, while experiencing high stress hot-spots. Arterial tissue growth along the surgical stitch lines is triggered mainly due to PA geometry and blood pressure, rather than due to material property differences in the artificial and native tissue. Thus, non-uniform growth patterns are observed along the arterial tissue proximal to the sutured boundaries. This computational approach is effective for the pre-surgical planning of complex patch surgeries to quantify the unbalanced growth of native arteries and artificial non-growing materials to develop optimal patch biomechanics for improved postoperative outcomes. © 2021",TRUE,Focuses on computational modeling for cardiovascular surgeries and doesn’t cover automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgeries.

The proposed sensor is designed to fully decouple the output response for normal, shear and angular forces. The proposed sensor is fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques and utilizes Neodymium magnets embedded in an elastomer over Hall sensors such that their displacement produces a voltage change that can be used to calculate the applied force. The initial spacing between the magnets and the Hall sensors is optimized to achieve a large displacement range using finite element method (FEM) simulations.

The purpose of this study was to test the biocompatibility of the SM with human limbus–derived epithelial cells with regard to their physical and biological properties. Methods: Different physical properties of SM were tested ex vivo by simulation on human corneas. In vitro, primary limbal epithelial cells from limbal explants were used to test biological properties such as cell migration, proliferation, metabolic activity, and limbal epithelial cell markers on the SM, hAM, and freeze-dried amniotic membrane (FDAM). Results: The surgical handleability of the SM was equivalent to that of the hAM. Ultrastructural and histological studies demonstrated that epithelial cells on the SM had the typical tightly apposed, polygonal, corneal epithelial cell morphology. The epithelial cells were well stratified on the SM, unlike on the hAM and FDAM. Rapid wound healing occurred on the SM within 3 days. Immunofluorescence studies showed positive expression of CK-19, Col-1, laminin, ZO-1, FN, and p-63 on the SM, plastic, and FDAM compared to positive expression of ZO-1, Col-1, laminin, FN, and p63 and negative expression of CK-19 in the hAM. Conclusions: These results indicate that the SM is a better substrate for limbal epithelial cell migration, proliferation, and tight junction formation. Altogether, the SM can provide a suitable alternative to the hAM for surgical application in sight-restoring operations.

On interaction between fatigue of reconstruction plate and time-dependent bone remodeling,Wan B.; Yoda N.; Zheng K.; Zhang Z.; Wu C.; Clark J.; Sasaki K.; Swain M.; Li Q.,2022,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105483,"Background and objective: The fibula free flap (FFF) has been extensively used to repair large segmental bone defects in the maxillofacial region. The reconstruction plate plays a key role in maintaining stability and load-sharing while the fibula unites with adjacent bone in the course of healing and remodeling. However, not all fibula flaps would fully unite, and fatigue of prosthetic devices has been recognized as one major concern for long-term load-bearing applications. This study aims to develop a numerical approach for predicting the fatigue life of the reconstruction plate by taking into account the effect of ongoing bone remodeling. Methods: The patient-specific mandible reconstruction with a prosthetic system is studied in this work. The 3D finite element model with heterogeneous material properties obtained from clinical computerized tomography (CT) data is developed for bone, and eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is adopted for the fatigue analysis of the plate. During the remodeling process, the changing apparent density and Young's modulus of bone are simulated in a step-wise fashion on the basis of Wolff's law, which is correlated with the specific clinical follow-up. The maximum biting forces were considered as the driving force on the bone remodeling, which are measured clinically at different time points (4, 16 and 28 months) after reconstruction surgery. Results: Under various occlusal loadings, the interaction between fatigue crack growth and bone remodeling is investigated to gain new insights for the future design of prosthetic devices. The simulation results reveal that appropriate remodeling of grafted bone could extend the fatigue life of fixation plates in a positive way. On the other hand, the rising occlusal load associated with healing and remodeling could lead to fatigue fracture of fixation plate and potentially cause severe bone resorption.

Finite element (FE) simulations are commonly used to assess micromotions at the bone-implant interface during daily activities, requiring accurate computational models. A key factor is the material model used to simulate bone properties. This study evaluated two plastic material models—Isotropic Crushable Foam (ICF) and softening Von-Mises (sVM)—for predicting primary fixation in femoral TKA components. Mechanical tests on human femoral trabecular bone samples under cyclic loading were replicated using FE simulations with ICF and sVM models. These models were then applied to FE simulations of three femoral TKA reconstructions, representing patients aged 57, 73, and 90 years. The ICF model replicated the gradual plastic deformation observed in experiments, unlike the sVM model, and more closely matched the permanent deformation of bone samples. In primary fixation simulations, micromotions at the bone-implant interface averaged 27 µm with ICF and 17 µm with sVM. While both predictions fall within acceptable ranges, the ICF model, as a pressure-dependent material model, more accurately replicates experimental energy dissipation and plastic deformation patterns, closely mirroring human bone's plastic behavior.

Conventional reconstruction methods, relying on rod and screw systems, often face challenges such as rod failure, sub-optimal stability, and limited osseointegration. This study proposes a novel design for a porous-based sacral reconstruction prosthesis. The design framework involves a two-step topology optimization (TO) process. The first TO step is utilized to obtain the external shape of a patient-specific prosthesis, while the second TO step determines varied density fields. These fields are later integrated with graded Gyroid structures to generate the porous-based sacral prosthesis. Finite element simulations reveal several benefits of the newly developed device. Firstly, considering only solid-based TO tends to result in a highly rigid spinal movement, which may not be entirely favorable. However, the porous-based technique allows for a wider design space, enabling the sacral device's stiffness to be more comprehensively engineered. Secondly, with porous integration, the prosthesis shows potential for promoting bone integration over time, thereby providing further biological fixation and improving long-term structural stability. Thirdly, the porous-based prosthesis outperforms conventional methods such as four-rod reconstruction (FRR) and four-rod plus anterior column reconstruction (FRACR) by reducing maximum von Mises stress in the instruments by approximately 50–80 %.

A new deformation simulation algorithm for elastic-plastic objects based on splat primitives,Zou Y.; Liu P.X.,2017,Computers in Biology and Medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.02.007,"To achieve high computational efficiency and realistic visual effects, a new simulation algorithm for soft tissue deformation, which is based on a shape-matching scheme using splat primitives, is presented for interactive real-time applications, such as surgery simulation and video games. The most important novelty of the proposed approach lies in the fact that surface splats instead of points are employed in the computation of the deformation and fracturing of an elastic-plastic object. By controlling the sampling density and automatically adjusting the size of the circular splats, the surface of the simulated object can be seamlessly covered with a much small number of splats than points. Splats are then divided into clusters using the K-Means clustering algorithm. As a result, the elastic-plastic deformation of these clusters can be simulated using a shape-matching strategy, allowing more degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the simulation.

Laser distribution maps (LDMs) are reconstructed through a series of images processed from the recorded video for each simulation session. Then, an experienced dermatologist classifies the collected LDMs into three different performance groups, which are quantitatively analyzed in terms of four performance indices. Results: The performance groups are characterized by using a combination of four proposed indices. The best-performing group exhibited the lowest amount of randomness in laser delivery and accurate estimation of mean spot distances. The training was only effective in the sliding treatment technique. After the training, omission errors decreased by 6.32% and better estimation of the mean spot distance of the actual size of the laser-emitting window was achieved. Gels required operators to be trained when the spot-by-spot technique was used, and imposed difficulties in maintaining regular laser delivery when the sliding technique was used. Conclusions: Because the proposed system is simple and highly affordable, it is expected to benefit many operators in clinics to train and maintain skilled performance in LHR treatment, which will eventually lead to accomplishing a uniform laser delivery for safe and effective LHR treatment. © 2014 Noh et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",TRUE,Focuses on training skills for laser hair removal instead of using automation to predict or assess aesthetic results in plastic or cancer-related surgery.
Modeling the biomechanics of swine mastication - An inverse dynamics approach,Basafa E.; Murphy R.J.; Gordon C.R.; Armand M.,2014,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.05.019,"A novel reconstructive alternative for patients with severe facial structural deformity is Le Fort-based, face-jaw-teeth transplantation (FJTT). To date, however, only ten surgeries have included underlying skeletal and jaw-teeth components, all yielding sub-optimal results and a need for a subsequent revision surgery, due to size mismatch and lack of precise planning. Numerous studies have proven swine to be appropriate candidates for translational studies including pre-operative planning of transplantation. An important aspect of planning FJTT is determining the optimal muscle attachment sites on the recipient’s jaw, which requires a clear understanding of mastication and bite mechanics in relation to the new donated upper and/or lower jaw. A segmented CT scan coupled with data taken from literature defined a biomechanical model of mandible and jaw muscles of a swine. The model was driven using tracked motion and external force data of one cycle of chewing published earlier, and predicted the muscle activation patterns as well as temporomandibular joint (TMJ) reaction forces and condylar motions. Two methods, polynomial and min/max optimization, were used for solving the muscle recruitment problem. Similar performances were observed between the two methods. On average, there was a mean absolute error (MAE) of <0.08 between the predicted and measured activation levels of all muscles, and an MAE of <7. N for TMJ reaction forces. Simulated activations qualitatively followed the same patterns as the reference data and there was very good agreement for simulated TMJ forces. The polynomial optimization produced a smoother output, suggesting that it is more suitable for studying such motions. Average MAE for condylar motion was 1.2. mm, which reduced to 0.37. mm when the input incisor motion was scaled to reflect the possible size mismatch between the current and original swine models. Results support the hypothesis that the model can be used for planning of facial transplantation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical modeling of pig chewing for surgery planning, not on predicting or evaluating aesthetic results, so it doesn’t fit the review’s goal on cosmetic assessments in plastic and cancer surgery."
Numerical and experimental investigations for the evaluation of the wear coefficient of reverse total shoulder prostheses,Mattei L.; Di Puccio F.; Joyce T.J.; Ciulli E.,2016,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.10.007,"In the present study, numerical and experimental wear investigations on reverse total shoulder arthroplasties (RTSAs) were combined in order to estimate specific wear coefficients, currently not available in the literature. A wear model previously developed by the authors for metal-on-plastic hip implants was adapted to RTSAs and applied in a double direction: firstly, to evaluate specific wear coefficients for RTSAs from experimental results and secondly, to predict wear distribution. In both cases, the Archard wear law (AR) and the wear law of UHMWPE (PE) were considered, assuming four different k functions. The results indicated that both the wear laws predict higher wear coefficients for RTSA with respect to hip implants, particularly the AR law, with k values higher than twofold the hip ones. Such differences can significantly affect predictive wear model results for RTSA, when non-specific wear coefficients are used. Moreover, the wear maps simulated with the two laws are markedly different, although providing the same wear volume. A higher wear depth (+51%) is obtained with the AR law, located at the dome of the cup, while with the PE law the most worn region is close to the edge. Taking advantage of the linear trend of experimental volume losses, the wear coefficients obtained with the AR law should be valid despite having neglected the geometry update in the model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",TRUE,Focuses on biomechanical wear of shoulder prostheses and doesn't cover automatic prediction or aesthetic evaluation in plastic or cancer-related surgery.
A model of articular cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery: A validation construct and computational insights,Salehghaffari S.; Dhaher Y.Y.,2014,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.03.003,"This study sought to develop a computational framework that emulates the articular cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery using transtibial portal technique. The proposed model included the tibia-femoral and patella-femoral joints, articular cartilage and menisci. Key surgical parameters were incorporated including bone-patellar-tendon-bone graft excision and pre-tensioning, tunnel morphology, bone plugs, and bone plug fixation. Several simulation steps were parameterized to reflect the clinically reported surgical procedure. Our focus was to explore the intra-operative effects of variations in tunnel directions on the selected metrics of joint mechanics during Lachman and Anterior Drawer tests. A mathematical construct capable of transforming the limited and heterogeneous experimental and surgical data to evidence-based validation was adopted to ensure the viability of the finite element models. We found that the proposed models, subject to a variation in tunnel directions, resulted in simulation outputs that favor the reported experimental data of Lachman and Anterior Drawer tests under uncertainty. Simulation results for a population of three-dimensional tunnel orientations provided insights into the graft-tunnel contact mechanics and the spatial stress distribution in the graft, insights that have been anecdotally observed in prior experimental studies. The intraarticular graft tension was found to be higher than the estimated in tunnel graft force, and larger differences were found for the least inclined tunnels exhibiting higher contact pressures, transverse bending and twisting of the graft and Von-Mises stress at the graft-femoral tunnel interface. Conversely, tunnels with high inclination angles exhibited higher intraarticular graft tension and Von-Mises stress at the graft-tibial bone plug interface. © 2014.",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical modeling of ligament reconstruction and doesn't cover automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery, so it doesn't fit the review's topic."
Improving tissue expansion protocols through computational modeling,Lee T.; Vaca E.E.; Ledwon J.K.; Bae H.; Topczewska J.M.; Turin S.Y.; Kuhl E.; Gosain A.K.; Tepole A.B.,2018,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2018.03.034,"Tissue expansion is a common technique in reconstructive surgery used to grow skin in vivo for correction of large defects. Despite its popularity, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of how stretch leads to growth of new skin. This has resulted in several arbitrary expansion protocols that rely on the surgeon's personal training and experience rather than on accurate predictive models. For example, choosing between slow or rapid expansion, or small or large inflation volumes remains controversial. Here we explore four tissue expansion protocols by systematically varying the inflation volume and the protocol duration in a porcine model. The quantitative analysis combines three-dimensional photography, isogeometric kinematics, and finite growth theory. Strikingly, all four protocols generate similar peak stretches, but different growth patterns: Smaller filling volumes of 30 ml per inflation did not result in notable expander-induced growth neither for the short nor for the long protocol; larger filling volumes of 60 ml per inflation trigger skin adaptation, with larger expander-induced growth in regions of larger stretch, and more expander-induced growth for the 14-day compared to the 10-day expansion protocol. Our results suggest that expander-induced growth is not triggered by the local stretch alone. While stretch is clearly a driver for growth, the local stretch at a given point is not enough to predict the expander-induced growth at that location. From a clinical perspective, our study suggests that longer expansion protocols are needed to ensure sufficient growth of sizable skin patches. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical modeling of tissue expansion without covering automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results, so it doesn't fit the review on aesthetic assessment in surgery."
High-Frequency Ultrasonic Forceps for the in Vivo Detection of Cancer during Breast-Conserving Surgery,Doyle T.E.; Butler A.P.; Salisbury M.J.; Bennett M.J.; Wagner G.M.; Al-Ghaib H.A.; Matsen C.B.,2020,"Journal of Medical Devices, Transactions of the ASME",10.1115/1.4047115,"A major aim in the surgical management of soft tissue cancers is to detect and remove all cancerous tissues while ensuring noncancerous tissue remains intact. Breast-conserving surgery provides a prime illustration of this aim, since remaining cancer in breast margins results in multiple surgeries, while removal of too much unaffected tissue often has undesirable cosmetic effects. Similarly, resection of benign lymph nodes during sentinel lymph node biopsy can cause deleterious health outcomes. The objective of this study was to create an intraoperative, in vivo device to address these challenges. Instant diagnostic information generated by this device could allow surgeons to precisely and completely remove all malignant tissue during the first surgery. Surgical forceps based on Martin forceps were instrumented at the tips with high-frequency ultrasonic transducers composed of polyvinylidene difluoride, a thickness-sensing rotary potentiometer at the base, and a spring to provide the appropriate restoring force. Transducer wires within the forceps were connected to an external high-frequency pulser-receiver, activating the forceps' transmitting transducer at 50 MHz and amplifying through-transmission signals from the receiving transducer. The forceps were tested with tissue-mimicking agarose phantoms embedded with 58-550 μm polyethylene microspheres to simulate various stages of cancer progression and to provide a range of measurement values. Results were compared with measurements from standard 50 MHz immersion transducers. The results showed that the forceps displayed similar sensitivity for attenuation and increased accuracy for wave speed. The forceps could also be extended to endoscopes and laparoscopes. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Mechanical properties of PVA material for tissue engineering applications,Karimi A.; Navidbakhsh M.,2014,Materials Technology,10.1179/1753555713Y.0000000115,"The paper presents the first scientific study of the quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) sponges. The PVA sponges have been considered as a potential implant material for replacement and repair of the soft tissues, including cartilage, liver and kidney. It is also used in ophthalmic surgical treatment, such as Lasik, cataract and refractive surgeries, to manipulate tissue during incision procedures in the eye to absorb fluid. However, a critical barrier to the use of the PVA sponge as a tissue replacement material is the lack of sufficient mechanical properties. In this study, the non-linear mechanical behaviour of a PVA sponge is investigated experimentally and computationally. A series of tension tests are designed and conducted for the PVA sponge. Hyperelastic strain energy density functions, including Yeoh, Ogden, Mooney-Rivlin and Neo-Hookean, are calibrated using the experimental data. A hyperelastic constitutive model is selected to best fit the axial behaviour of the sponge. Its general prediction ability is verified using finite element simulations of PVA tensile experiments. The results in terms of the maximum stress before the holding for the P sponge demonstrate that it can bear 11–94% and 20–17% more stress compared to the EYETEC and CENEFOM sponges respectively. The swelling ratio of the P sponge was 26–78 and 1–78% more than that of the CENEFOM and EYETEC sponges respectively. Moreover, the Yeoh model was selected to represent the non-linear behaviour of the PVA material, which can be used in future biomechanical simulations of the soft tissues. These results can be utilised to understand the QLV and swelling mechanism of PVA sponges and have implications for ophthalmic and plastic surgeries, as well as wound healing and tissue engineering purposes. © 2014 W.

Simulating contact using the elastic foundation algorithm in OpenSim,Hast M.W.; Hanson B.G.; Baxter J.R.,2019,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2018.11.025,"Modeling joint contact in OpenSim is not well understood. This study systematically investigated the variables associated with the elastic foundation contact model within OpenSim by performing a series of controlled benchtop experiment and concomitant simulations. Four metal-on-plastic interactions were modeled, including a model of a total knee replacement (TKR). Load-displacement curves were recorded during cyclic loading between 100 and 750 N. Geometries were imported and into OpenSim and contact mechanics were modeled with the on-board elastic foundation algorithm. A hybrid optimization algorithm determined that stiffness and dissipation coefficients for TKR implants were 1.52 × 10^10 N/m and 57.7 Ns/m, respectively. Estimations of contact forces were 10.2% of blinded experimental data (average root mean square error: 76.82 ± 11.47 N). In the second portion of this study, freely available eTibia TKR renderings were used to test the ubiquity of the tuning parameters. They were also used to perform a sensitivity analysis of material stiffness and mesh density with regard to penetration depth and computational time. When a stiffness of 1 × 10^10 was applied to an eTibia model with 5000 faces, a 100 kg load caused 0.259 mm of penetration. Under the same conditions, the tuned model experienced 0.300 mm of penetration. Material stiffnesses between 1 × 10^13 and 1 × 10^15 N/m increased computation time by factors of 12–23. This study provides much needed clarity regarding the use of the OpenSim EF algorithm.

Calcium phosphate cement reinforced with poly (vinyl alcohol) fibers: An experimental and numerical failure analysis,Paknahad A.; Goudarzi M.; Kucko N.W.; Leeuwenburgh S.C.G.; Sluys L.J.,2021,Acta Biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2020.10.014,"Calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) have been widely used during the past decades as biocompatible bone substitution in maxillofacial, oral and orthopedic surgery. CPCs are injectable and are chemically resemblant to the mineral phase of native bone. Nevertheless, their low fracture toughness and high brittleness reduce their clinical applicability to weakly loaded bones. Reinforcement of CPC matrix with polymeric fibers can overcome these mechanical drawbacks and significantly enhance their toughness and strength. Such fiber-reinforced calcium phosphate cements (FRCPCs) have the potential to act as advanced bone substitute in load-bearing anatomical sites. This work achieves integrated experimental and numerical characterization of the mechanical properties of FRCPCs under bending and tensile loading. To this end, a 3-D numerical gradient enhanced damage model combined with a dimensionally-reduced fiber model are employed to develop a computational model for material characterization and to simulate the failure process of fiber-reinforced CPC matrix based on experimental data. In addition, an advanced interfacial constitutive law, derived from micromechanical pull-out tests, is used to represent the interaction between the polymeric fiber and CPC matrix. The presented computational model is successfully validated with the experimental results and offers a firm basis for further investigations on the development of numerical and experimental analysis of fiber-reinforced bone cements. © 2020 The Authors.

A phenomenological contact model: Understanding the graft-tunnel interaction in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery,Salehghaffari S.; Dhaher Y.Y.,2015,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.04.034,"In this paper, we sought to expand the fidelity of a validated model of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) procedure by incorporating a stick-slip contact model with linear pressure-overclosure relationship at the interface. The suggested model is characterized by three unknown parameters, friction coefficient, shear stress softening and contact stiffness. In the absence of any isolated experiments exploring the graft-tunnel interactions during an aggregate joint load, the calibration data used in this study are derived from a reported biomechanical study. A Bayesian calibration procedure was employed to find the unknown probability distribution function (PDF) of these contact parameters. Initially, the response surface approximations of the predicted graft forces from laxity test simulations was adopted to estimate the likelihood of noisy experimental data reported in the literature. Then, the wide domain of contact parameters was sampled sequentially based on the Marcov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with acceptance-rejection criteria to search for population of samples in significantly narrower domain of unknown parameters that are associated with the highest occurrence likelihood of noisy experimental data. Our simulations with calibrated contact parameters indicate that pre-tensioning applied at 30° of flexion leads to larger graft force after the joint is fully extended compared to the graft force when the same pre-tensioning force is applied at full extension. Moreover, regardless of the pre-tensioning force, the graft-tunnel contact pressure is larger when the fixation of the graft is performed at full extension, increasing with the pre-tensioning force. © 2015.",TRUE,"Centers on biomechanical modeling in ACL reconstruction without discussing automatic prediction or assessment of aesthetics in plastic or cancer surgery, so it doesn't align with the review's focus."

In this paper, we present the development of a software prototype for augmentation mammaplasty simulation solely based on 3-D surface scans, from which patient-specific finite-element models are generated in a semiautomatic process. The finite-element model is used to preoperatively simulate the expected breast shapes using physical soft-tissue mechanics. Our approach uses a novel mechanism based on so-called displacement templates, which, for a specific implant shape and position, describe the respective internal body forces.

Virtual downsizing for decision support in mitral valve repair,Neugebauer M.; Tautz L.; Hüllebrand M.; Sündermann S.; Degener F.; Goubergrits L.; Kühne T.; Falk V.; Hennemuth A.,2019,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-018-1868-6,"Purpose: Various options are available for the treatment of mitral valve insufficiency, including reconstructive approaches such as annulus correction through ring implants. The correct choice of general therapy and implant is relevant for an optimal outcome. Additional to guidelines, decision support systems (DSS) can provide decision aid by means of virtual intervention planning and predictive simulations. Our approach on virtual downsizing is one of the virtual intervention tools that are part of the DSS workflow. It allows for emulating a ring implantation based on patient-specific lumen geometry and vendor-specific implants. Methods: Our approach is fully automatic and relies on a lumen mask and an annulus contour as inputs. Both are acquired from previous DSS workflow steps. A virtual surface- and contour-based model of a vendor-specific ring design (26–40 mm) is generated. For each case, the ring geometry is positioned with respect to the original, patient-specific annulus and additional anatomical landmarks. The lumen mesh is parameterized to allow for a vertex-based deformation with respect to the user-defined annulus. Derived from post-interventional observations, specific deformation schemes are applied to atrium and ventricle and the lumen mesh is altered with respect to the ring location. Results: For quantitative evaluation, the surface distance between the deformed lumen mesh and segmented post-operative echo lumen close to the annulus was computed for 11 datasets. The results indicate a good agreement. An arbitrary subset of six datasets was used for a qualitative evaluation of the complete lumen. Two domain experts compared the deformed lumen mesh with post-interventional echo images. All deformations were deemed plausible. Conclusion: Our approach on virtual downsizing allows for an automatic creation of plausible lumen deformations. As it takes only a few seconds to generate results, it can be added to a virtual intervention toolset without unnecessarily increasing the pipeline complexity. © 2018, CARS.",TRUE,"Centers on virtual planning for mitral valve repair and functional anatomy, without covering automated prediction or evaluation of cosmetic outcomes in plastic or cancer surgery."
Conceptual design and implantation of an external fixator with improved mobility for knee rehabilitation,Gatti G.,2017,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1080/10255842.2017.1307342,"A hinged external fixator is used to allow early knee rehabilitation in case of injury or trauma, as an alternative approach to immobilization. It is mainly adopted for the treatment of dislocations, which involve tearing of the ligaments, and it basically consists of two links connected to each other by a revolute joint. Each link is fixed to the femur and tibia via pin fixation, and the revolute joint is approximately aligned to the knee flexion-extension (FE) axis. The advantage in its implantation is to protect ligament reconstruction, while allowing for an aggressive rehabilitation. Traditional fixators only accommodate the functional flexion movement in a limited range, i.e. where the anatomical movement is closer to a planar circular trajectory. This paper presents the conceptual design and implantation procedure of a double-axis fixator, which accommodates both FE and longitudinal internal-external rotation. The procedure is based on accurate knee kinematics measurements and on computer-aided multibody simulations to assist clinicians in the implantation.

Linear Elastic Properties of the Facial Soft Tissues Using an Aspiration Device: Towards Patient Specific Characterization,Luboz V.; Promayon E.; Payan Y.,2014,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10439-014-1098-1,"Biomechanical modeling of the facial soft tissue behavior is needed in aesthetic or maxillo-facial surgeries where the simulation of the bone displacements cannot accurately predict the visible outcome on the patient’s face.

Using a specifically designed aspiration device, the facial soft tissues deformation is measured at four different locations (cheek, cheekbone, forehead, and lower lip) on 16 young subjects. The stiffness is estimated from the deformations generated by a set of negative pressures using an inverse analysis based on a Neo Hookean model.

The commercially used nails are fabricated from Stainless Steel or Titanium. Composite-materials (CM) mainly carbon-fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) have been gaining more interest and popularity due to their properties, such as modulus of elasticity close to that of bone, increased fatigue strength, and radio-opacity to irradiation that permits a better visualization of the healing process. The use of CFRP instead of metals allows better control of different directional movements along a fracture site. The purpose of this analysis was to design a CM intramedullary nail to enable micromovements as depicted on a finite element analysis method. Methods: We designed a three-dimentional femoral nail model. Three CFRP with different laminates arrangements, were included in the analysis. The finite element analysis involved applying vertical and horizontal loads on each of the designed and tested nails. Results: The nails permitted a transverse micromovement of 0.75. mm for the 45° lay-up and 1.5. mm for the 90° lay-up for the CM, 1.38. mm for the Titanium and 0.74. mm for the Stainless Steel nails. The recorded axial movements were 0.53. mm for the 45° lay-up, 0.87. mm for the 90° lay-up, 0.46. mm for the unsymmetrical lay-up CM, 0.046 for the Titanium and 0.02 for the Stainless Steel nails. Overall, the simulations showed that nail transverse micromovements can be reduced by using 45° carbon fiber orientations. Similar results were observed with each metal nails. Interpretation: We found that nail micromovements can be controlled by changing the directional stiffness using different lay-up orientations. These results can be useful for predicting nail micromovements under specified loading conditions which are crucial for stimulating callus formation in the early stages of healing. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",TRUE,Focuses on biomechanical analysis of fracture fixation devices and doesn’t cover automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery.

The clinical outcomes of AVR are strongly dependent on an appropriate choice of both prosthesis size and replacement technique, which are, at present, strictly related to surgeon's experience and skill. Therefore, also this treatment, like most reconstructive procedures in cardiac surgery, remains ""more art than science"" [1].

Advanced interactive medical visualization on the GPU,Tatarchuk N.; Shopf J.; DeCoro C.,2008,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,10.1016/j.jpdc.2008.06.011,"Interactive visual analysis of a patient's anatomy by means of computer-generated 3D imagery is crucial for diagnosis, pre-operative planning, and surgical training. The task of visualization is no longer limited to producing images at interactive rates, but also includes the guided extraction of significant features to assist the user in the data exploration process. An effective visualization module has to perform a problem-specific abstraction of the dataset, leading to a more compact and hence more efficient visual representation. Moreover, many medical applications, such as surgical training simulators and pre-operative planning for plastic and reconstructive surgery, require the visualization of datasets that are dynamically modified or even generated by a physics-based simulation engine. In this paper we present a set of approaches that allow interactive exploration of medical datasets in real time. Our method combines direct volume rendering via ray-casting with a novel approach for isosurface extraction and re-use directly on graphics processing units (GPU)s in a single framework. The isosurface extraction technique takes advantage of the recently introduced Microsoft(R) DirectX®10 pipeline for dynamic surface extraction in real time using geometry shaders. This surface is constructed in polygonal form and can be directly used post-extraction for collision detection, rendering, and optimization. The resulting polygonal surface can also be analyzed for geometric properties, such as feature area, volume and size deviation, which is crucial for semi-automatic tumor analysis as used, for example, in colonoscopy. Additionally, we have developed a technique for real-time volume data analysis by providing an interactive user interface for designing material properties for organs in the scanned volume. Combining isosurface with direct volume rendering allows visualization of the surface properties as well as the context of tissues surrounding the region and gives better context for navigation.

Does graft construct lengthening at the fixations cause an increase in anterior laxity following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in vivo?,Smith C.K.; Hull M.L.; Howell S.M.,2010,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.4001027,"A millimeter-for-millimeter relation between an increase in length of an anterior cruciate ligament graft construct and an increase in anterior laxity has been demonstrated in multiple in vitro studies. Based on this relation, a 3 mm increase in length of the graft construct following surgery could manifest as a 3 mm increase in anterior laxity in vivo, which is considered clinically unstable. Hence, the two primary objectives were to determine whether the millimeter-for-millimeter relation exists in vivo for slippage-resistant fixation of a soft-tissue graft and, if it does not exist, then to what extent the increase in stiffness caused by biologic healing of the graft to the bone tunnel offsets the potential increase in anterior laxity resulting from lengthening at the sites of fixation. Sixteen subjects were treated with a fresh-frozen, nonirradiated, nonchemically processed tibialis allograft. Tantalum markers were injected into the graft, fixation devices, and bones. On the day of surgery and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months, Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis was used to compute anterior laxity at 150 N of anterior force and the total slippage from both sites of fixation. A simple linear regression was performed to determine whether the millimeter-for-millimeter relation existed and a springs-in-series model of the graft construct was used to determine the extent to which the increase in stiffness caused by biological healing of the graft to the bone tunnel offset the increase in anterior laxity resulting from lengthening at the sites of fixation. There was no correlation between lengthening at the sites of fixation and the increase in anterior laxity at 1 month (R2 = 0.0, slope = 0.2). Also, the increase in stiffness of the graft construct caused by biologic healing of the graft to the bone tunnel offset 0.7 mm of the 1.5 mm potential increase in anterior laxity resulting from lengthening at the sites of fixation. This relatively large offset of nearly 50% occurred because lengthening at the sites of fixation was small.

A hyperelastic finite-element model of human skin for interactive real-time surgical simulation,Lapeer R.J.; Gasson P.D.; Karri V.,2011,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2009.2038364,"A finite-element (FE) model of human skin is proposed for future use in an interactive real-time surgical simulation to teach surgeons procedures, such as facial reconstruction using skin-flap repair. For this procedure, skin is cut into flaps that are stretched to cover openings in the face. Thus, the model must recreate the visual, haptic, and force feedback expected by the surgeon. To develop the FE model, a series of in vitro experiments were conducted on samples of human skin, subjected to uniaxial and planar tensile straining. Reduced polynomial hyperelastic (HE) materials were found to fit many of the samples stress-strain data well. Finally, an explicit dynamic FE mesh was developed based on the fitted HE material models. A total Lagrangian formulation with the half-step central difference method was employed to integrate the dynamic equation of motion of the mesh. The mesh was integrated into two versions of a real-time skin simulator: a single-threaded version running on a computers main central processing unit and a multithreaded version running on the computers graphics card. The latter was achieved by exploiting recent advances in programmable graphics technology. © 2011 IEEE.",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical modeling for surgical simulation without covering automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results, so it doesn't match the review's focus on aesthetic assessment in plastic and cancer surgery."
A method for automatically optimizing medical devices for treating heart failure: Designing polymeric injection patterns,Wenk J.F.; Wall S.T.; Peterson R.C.; Helgerson S.L.; Sabbah H.N.; Burger M.; Stander N.; Ratcliffe M.B.; Guccione J.M.,2009,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.4000165,"Heart failure continues to present a significant medical and economic burden throughout the developed world. Novel treatments involving the injection of polymeric materials into the myocardium of the failing left ventricle (LV) are currently being developed, which may reduce elevated myofiber stresses during the cardiac cycle and act to retard the progression of heart failure. A finite element (FE) simulation-based method was developed in this study that can automatically optimize the injection pattern of the polymeric ""inclusions"" according to a specific objective function, using commercially available software tools. The FE preprocessor TRUEGRID® was used to create a parametric axisymmetric LV mesh matched to experimentally measured end-diastole and end-systole metrics from dogs with coronary microembolization-induced heart failure. Passive and active myocardial material properties were defined by a pseudo-elastic-strain energy function and a time-varying elastance model of active contraction, respectively, that were implemented in the FE software LS-DYNA. The companion optimization software LS-OPT was used to communicate directly with TRUEGRID® to determine FE model parameters, such as defining the injection pattern and inclusion characteristics. The optimization resulted in an intuitive optimal injection pattern (i.e., the one with the greatest number of inclusions) when the objective function was weighted to minimize mean end-diastolic and endsystolic myofiber stress and ignore LV stroke volume. In contrast, the optimization resulted in a nonintuitive optimal pattern (i.e., 3 inclusions longitudinally X 6 inclusions circumferentially) when both myofiber stress and stroke volume were incorporated into the objective function with different weights.

An analytical model is derived for this case under assumptions typically made in the literature and comparisons between the CFD study and the analytical model are presented.

Laser transport through thin scattering layers,Eze R.; Kumar S.,2010,Applied Optics,10.1364/AO.49.000358,"Many modern applications of lasers involve understanding the transport of radiation through thin layers. The interactions of continuous wave and pulsed lasers with skin in dermatological use related to surgery and cosmetic procedures are examples of such. These highly scattering thin layers in skin are best modeled by the Monte Carlo method. However, most traditional Monte Carlo models may inaccurately account for the presence of thin layers. As an example, the very thin epidermis, with its highly absorbing melanin, is known to influence the laser penetration significantly. If the Monte Carlo model is implemented without special features, then the results of the simulation will show incorrect effects of thin layers because the path length of most photons would be significantly larger than the layer thickness. As a result, the computed photon travel path length would simply not feel the presence of the layer. In this paper, we present numerical and algorithmic features for computation of radiation transport through thin layers. It is noted that, while Monte Carlo without special features smears the radiative effect of the layers, the refined technique indicates that layers have a great impact on the absorption of energy, especially if the layer properties are distinctly different from those of the adjacent layers.

FSI analysis of the coughing mechanism in a human trachea,Malvè M.; Del Palomar A.P.; López-Villalobos J.L.; Ginel A.; Doblaré M.,2010,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10439-010-9951-3,"The main physiological function of coughing is to remove from the airways the mucus and foreign particles that enter the lungs with respirable air. However, in patients with endotracheal tubes, further surgery has to be performed to improve cough effectiveness. Thus, it is necessary to analyze how this process is carried out in healthy tracheas to suggest ways to improve its efficacy in operated patients. A finite element model of a human trachea is developed and used to analyze the deformability of the tracheal walls under coughing. The geometry of the trachea is obtained from CT of a 70-year-old male patient. A fluid structure interaction approach is used to analyze the deformation of the wall when the fluid (in this case, air) flows inside the trachea. A structured hexahedral-based grid for the tracheal walls and an unstructured tetrahedral-based mesh with coincident nodes for the fluid are used to perform the simulations with the finite element-based commercial software code (ADINA R&D Inc.). Tracheal wall is modeled as an anisotropic fiber reinforced hyperelastic solid material in which the different orientation of the fibers is introduced. The implantation of an endotracheal prosthesis is simulated. Boundary conditions for breathing and coughing are applied at the inlet and at the outlet surfaces of the fluid mesh. The collapsibility of a human trachea under breathing and coughing is shown in terms of flow patterns and wall stresses. The ability of the model to reproduce the normal breathing and coughing is proved by comparing the deformed shape of the trachea with experimental results. Moreover the implantation of an endotracheal prosthesis would be related with a decrease of coughing efficiency, as clinically seen. © 2010 Biomedical Engineering Society.",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical analysis of coughing in the trachea instead of predicting or evaluating aesthetic results in plastic or cancer surgery, so it doesn’t fit the review’s topic."

In this paper, a finite element biomechanical model of the breast of a female patient before an augmentation mammoplasty was generated using computer tomography images. Prosthesis insertion during surgery was simulated using the theory of finite elasticity. Hyperelastic constitutive models were considered for breast tissues and silicone implants. The deformed geometry obtained from finite element analysis was compared qualitatively and quantitatively with the real breast shape of the patient lying in supine position, with root-mean-squared errors less than 3. mm.

Commercial software was employed to study the mechanical behavior and fatigue performance of different materials found in commercially available stent-graft systems. Specifically, the effects of crimping, deployment, and cyclic pressure loading on stent-graft fatigue life, radial force, and wall compliances were simulated and analyzed for two types of realistic but different Nitinol materials (NITI-1 and NITI-2) and grafts (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene-ePTFE and polyethylene therephthalate-PET). The results show that NITI-1 stent has a better crimping performance than NITI-2. Under representative cyclic pressure loading, both NITI-1 and NITI-2 sealing stents are located in the safe zone of the fatigue-life diagram; however, the fatigue resistance of an NITI-1 stent is better than that of an NITI-2 stent. It was found that the two types of sealing stents do not damage a healthy neck artery. In the aneurysm section, the NITI-1&ePTFE, NITI-1&PET, and NITI-2&PET combinations were free of fatigue fracture when subjected to conditions of radial stress between 50 and 150 mmHg. In contrast, the safety factor for the NITI-2&ePFTE combination was only 0.67, which is not acceptable for proper AAA stent-graft design.

Development and validation methodology of the Nuss procedure surgical planner,Rechowicz K.J.; McKenzie F.D.,2013,SIMULATION,10.1177/0037549713496153,"Surgical planners are used to achieve the optimal outcome for surgery. They are especially desired in procedures where a positive aesthetic outcome is the primary goal, such as the Nuss procedure which is a minimally invasive surgery for correcting pectus excavatum (PE) – a congenital chest wall deformity which is characterized by a deep depression of the sternum. The Nuss procedure consists of placement of a metal bar(s) underneath the sternum, thereby forcibly changing the geometry of the ribcage. Because of the prevalence of PE and the popularity of the Nuss procedure, the demand to perform this surgery is greater than ever. Therefore, a Nuss procedure surgical planner is an invaluable planning tool ensuring an optimal physiological and aesthetic outcome. We propose the development and validation of the Nuss procedure planner. First, a generic model of the ribcage is developed. Then, the computed tomography (CT) data collected from actual patients with PE is used to create a set of patient-specific finite element models (FEM). Based on finite element analyses (FEA) a force–displacement data set is created. This data is used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to generalize the data set. In order to evaluate the planning process, a methodology which uses an average shape of the chest for comparison with results of the Nuss procedure planner is developed. Haptic feedback and inertial tracking is also implemented.

Past reports have suggested that increasing the number of screws can result in the increase in spinal rigidity, decreased spine mobility, loss of bone and, possibly, screw loosening. In order to overcome this, options to have constrained, semi-constrained or hybrid screw and plate systems were later introduced. The purpose of this study is to compare the stability achieved by four and two screws using different plate systems after one-level corpectomy with placement of cage.

The kinematic stability of a two-screw plate was found to be statistically equivalent to a four-screw plate for one-level corpectomy.

However, little is known about their intrinsic mechanical behavior and their interactions with surrounding tissues. The primary objective of the current study was to analyze the mechanical behavior of barbed sutures using a finite element analysis approach.

Second, the effect of an applied displacement to a barb anchored either in skin or tendon material for both the suture and the surrounding tissue. The results indicate that the flexibility of the barb can be increased or decreased by changing the barb geometry. It was concluded that the barb geometry and design need to be modified for use with different types of tissue. For example, in order to achieve the best mechanical anchoring with skin tissue the barb should be more flexible compared to the one designed to work with tendon tissue.

A biomechanical model of Peyronie's disease,Gefen A.; Chen J.; Elad D.,2000,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/S0021-9290(00)00122-6,"Peyronie's disease is a pathological condition of the penis which is characterized by localized ossification of the tunica albuginea. A common symptom of the chronic stage is penile deformity during erection, which is frequently associated with pain and erectile dysfunction. A two-dimensional biomechanical model of the penis was applied to study the development of Peyronie's disease by simulating the mechanical stress distribution which would result from the interaction of the ossified tunical tissue with other penile soft tissues. The model was solved by using commercial finite element software for a characteristic erectile pressure. The results demonstrate that Peyronie's plaques may induce intensified stresses around the penile nerves and blood vessels, up to double those in the normal penis. These elevated stresses may cause a painful sensation of neural origin or ischemia in regions of compressed vascular tissue. Severe penile deformities have been shown to develop if Peyronie's plaques develop only around one of the corpora cavernosa due to the non-homogeneous resistance of the tunica to expansion during erection.

A statistical wisp model and pseudophysical approaches for interactive hairstyle generation,Choe B.; Ko H.-S.,2005,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,10.1109/TVCG.2005.20,"This paper presents an interactive technique that produces static hairstyles by generating individual hair strands of the desired shape and color, subject to the presence of gravity and collisions. A variety of hairstyles can be generated by adjusting the wisp parameters, while the deformation is solved efficiently, accounting for the effects of gravity and collisions. Wisps are generated employing statistical approaches. As for hair deformation, we propose a method which is based on physical simulation concepts, but is simplified to efficiently solve the static shape of hair. On top of the statistical wisp model and the deformation solver, a constraint-based styler is proposed to model artificial features that oppose the natural flow of hair under gravity and hair elasticity, such as a hairpin.
