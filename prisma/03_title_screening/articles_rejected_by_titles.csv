Finite Element Analysis and Simulation of 316L Stainless Steel and Titanium Alloy for Orthopedic Hip and Knee Prosthetics,Ikumapayi O.M.; Bankole O.O.; Bayode A.; Onu P.; Ting T.T.,2025,Prosthesis,10.3390/prosthesis7030064,"Background: Ferrous metals are used extensively in the manufacturing of plates, pins, Kirschner wires (K-wires), and screws, and in the performance of partial and total joint replacement surgeries for the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. The primary surgical procedures commonly performed are hip and knee replacement surgeries. Metals possess a combination of high modulus, yield point, and ductility, rendering them well suited for load-bearing applications, as they can withstand significant loads without experiencing substantial deformations or permanent alterations in their dimensions. Application of metals and alloys is of prime importance in orthopedics as they lead the way to overcoming many issues encountered in implant use. In some instances, pure metals are used, but alloys consisting of two or more elements typically exhibit greater material characteristics, including corrosion resistance as well as toughness. The first item to address when selecting a metallic implant material is its biocompatibility. In this regard, three classes of materials are also commonly known as biomedical metals—316L stainless steel, pure titanium, and titanium alloys. Objective: The aim of this work is to create a model describing the material behavior and then simulate the metals under a load of 2300 N, which is equivalent to plastic loading. Methods: Under ten different case studies, a sub-routine was developed to combine the material characteristics of titanium and 316L stainless steel with the software. Results: The outcomes of the research were then investigated. A femur model was created using ANSYS software, and two materials, stainless steel and titanium, were used. The model was then exposed to a force of 2300 N. © 2025 by the authors.",TRUE,"Talks about metal implants, not plastic or cancer surgery aesthetics."
A Miniaturized Ultrasonic Micro-Hole Perforator for Minimally Invasive Craniotomy,Liao S.; Li X.; Deng M.; Liu B.; Wang Y.; Saw S.N.; Li Z.,2023,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2023.3234965,"Objective: Micro-hole perforation on skull is urgently desired for minimally invasive insertion of micro-tools in brain for diagnostic or treatment purpose. However, a micro drill bit would easily fracture, making it difficult to safely generate a micro-hole on the hard skull. Methods: In this study, we present a method for ultrasonic vibration assisted micro-hole perforation on skull in a manner similar to subcutaneous injection on soft tissue. For this purpose, a high amplitude miniaturized ultrasonic tool with a 500 μm tip diameter micro-hole perforator was developed with simulation and experimental characterization. In-depth investigation of micro-hole generation mechanism was performed with systematic experiments on animal skull with a bespoke test rig; effects of vibration amplitude and feed rate on hole forming characteristics were systematically studied. It was observed that by exploiting skull bone's unique structural and material properties, the ultrasonic micro-perforator could locally damage bone tissue with micro-porosities, induce sufficient plastic deformation to bone tissue around the micro-hole and refrain elastic recovery after tool withdraw, generating a micro-hole on skull without material. Results: Under optimized conditions, high quality micro-holes could be formed on the hard skull with a force (<1 N) even smaller than that for subcutaneous injection on soft skin. Conclusion: This study would provide a safe and effective method and a miniaturized device for micro-hole perforation on skull for minimally invasive neural interventions. © 1964-2012 IEEE.",TRUE,"Focuses on surgical tools, not aesthetic outcome prediction."
Bone stress relaxation in press-fit femoral knee implant fixation: A combined experimental and computational analysis,Gersie T.; Bitter T.; Freeman R.; Verdonschot N.; Janssen D.,2025,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2025.107067,"Aseptic loosening is the leading cause of revision in cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA), emphasizing the need for strong initial stability. Pre-clinical evaluations are essential for understanding implant fixation mechanics. Finite element (FE) models often rely on linear elastic bone material models, which inadequately represent bone behavior. Incorporating bone plasticity enhances predictions of primary stability, but may overestimate fixation by neglecting bone viscoelasticity and abrasion. Stress relaxation reduces press-fit forces, while bone abrasion weakens fixation strength. This study incorporated bone relaxation and abrasion into FE simulations of femoral TKA fixation and compared results to experimental measurements. Cadaveric femurs were implanted with femoral components, and strain gauges recorded outer surface strain over 24 h. A pull-off test evaluated fixation strength. FE models, using a plastic-viscoelastic bone material model, simulated these phases with varying levels of bone abrasion. The computational model without abrasion predicted implant strain 350 % higher than experimental measurements. 0.75 mm of virtual abrasion reduced overestimation to 150 %. Experimental strain reductions due to bone relaxation varied per reconstruction from 17 % to 37 %, while computational predictions were on average 41 % lower. Substantial variability was observed in both the experimental and simulated pull-off forces. Simulations without abrasion showed 180 %–360 % higher pull-off forces than the experiments. Including 0.5 mm of virtual abrasion reduced pull-off forces, aligning them more closely with experimental values, though 0.75 mm led to underestimation in some cases. These results highlight the need to include bone relaxation and abrasion in simulations to optimize implant designs and surgical outcomes. © 2025 The Authors",TRUE,"Focuses on knee implants, not on aesthetic surgery predictions."
A Gaussian process approach for rapid evaluation of skin tension,Nagle M.; Conroy Broderick H.; Vedel C.; Destrade M.; Fop M.; Ní Annaidh A.,2024,Acta Biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2024.05.025,"Skin tension plays a pivotal role in clinical settings, it affects scarring, wound healing and skin necrosis. Despite its importance, there is no widely accepted method for assessing in vivo skin tension or its natural pre-stretch. This study aims to utilise modern machine learning (ML) methods to develop a model that uses non-invasive measurements of surface wave speed to predict clinically useful skin properties such as stress and natural pre-stretch. A large dataset consisting of simulated wave propagation experiments was created using a simplified two-dimensional finite element (FE) model. Using this dataset, a sensitivity analysis was performed, highlighting the effect of the material parameters and material model on the Rayleigh and supersonic shear wave speeds. Then, a Gaussian process regression model was trained to solve the ill-posed inverse problem of predicting stress and pre-stretch of skin using measurements of surface wave speed. This model had good predictive performance (R2 = 0.9570) and it was possible to interpolate simplified parametric equations to calculate the stress and pre-stretch. To demonstrate that wave speed measurements could be obtained cheaply and easily, a simple experiment was devised to obtain wave speed measurements from synthetic skin at different values of pre-stretch. These experimental wave speeds agree well with the FE simulations, and a model trained solely on the FE data provided accurate predictions of synthetic skin stiffness. Both the simulated and experimental results provide further evidence that elastic wave measurements coupled with ML models are a viable non-invasive method to determine in vivo skin tension. Statement of significance: To prevent unfavourable patient outcomes from reconstructive surgery, it is necessary to determine relevant subject-specific skin properties. For example, during a skin graft, it is necessary to estimate the pre-stretch of the skin to account for shrinkage upon excision. Existing methods are invasive or rely on the experience of the clinician. Our work aims to present an innovative framework to non-invasively determine in vivo material properties using the speed of a surface wave travelling through the skin. Our findings have implications for the planning of surgical procedures and provides further motivation for the use of elastic wave measurements to determine in vivo material properties. © 2024 The Author(s)",TRUE,"Focuses on skin tension prediction, not aesthetic outcomes."

Identified trends showed statistical significance when setting the AirSeal® System to Low smoke evacuation that it reduces the percentage of particulate matter at the Access Port opening. Additionally, it was observed that when utilising a laparoscopic tool a similar trend in particle distributions were seen between either insufflation and access system at the opening of the Access Port and trocar. Evacuation times for SSPM removal within the AirSeal® System showed an overall average to ≥95% reduction of 5.64 min within the surgical cavity, 3.69 min at the Access Port opening, and 3.61 min within the smoke evacuation line.

Biomechanical analysis and design method for patient-specific reconstructive implants for large bone defects of the distal lateral femur,Wu P.-K.; Lee C.-W.; Sun W.-H.; Lin C.-L.,2022,Biosensors,10.3390/bios12010004,"This study aims to develop a generalizable method for designing a patient-specific reconstructive scaffold implant for a large distal lateral femur defect using finite element (FE) analysis and topology optimization. A 3D solid-core implant for the distal femur defect was designed to withhold the femur load. Data from FE analysis of the solid implant were used for topology optimization to obtain a ‘bone scaffold implant’ with light-weight internal cavity and surface lattice features to allow for filling with bone material. The bone scaffold implant weighed 69.6% less than the original solid-core implant. The results of FE simulation show that the bone repaired with the bone scaffold implant had lower total displacement (12%), bone plate von Mises stress (34%), bone maximum first principal stress (33%), and bone maximum first principal strain (32%) than did bone repaired with bone cement. The trend in experimental strain with increasing load on the composite femur was greater with bone cement than with the bone scaffold implant.

A Six-Axis FBG Force/Moment Sensor With Nonlinear Decoupling and Fault Tolerance for Laparoscopic Instruments,Li T.; Huang P.; Wang S.; Li C.; Qiu L.; Lim C.M.; Ren H.,2024,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,10.1109/TIE.2023.3344822,"In this article, a six-axis fiber Bragg grating (FBG) force/moment (F/M) sensor is created and integrated into laparoscopic forceps to retrieve interactive force feedback for surgery. This sensor consists of a 3-D-printed ellipsoidal hollow elastomer and six Stewart-like suspended FBGs in the elastomer, leading to a compact size and high sensitivity. An algorithm based on the seagull optimization algorithm and extreme learning machine (SOA-ELM) is proposed to depress the nonlinear crosstalk effect of six-axis F/M output and realize fault tolerance of FBG fractures. Compared with the backpropagation neural network and extreme learning machine method, the experiment results show that the nonlinear decoupling performance based on SOA-ELM harvests an excellent accuracy with a small error of less than 6%, as well as the excellent fault-tolerance effect with an error below 10% while one FBG fractures. The maximum dynamic error of the designed sensor is within 10%. The feasibility and effectiveness of the designed sensor for real-time force feedback in laparoscopic surgery are demonstrated through simulation tasks of threading, suturing, cutting the ex vivo tissues, and operation in the oral cavity.

Multi-scale constitutive model of human trabecular bone,Jankowski K.; Pawlikowski M.; Domański J.,2023,Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics,10.1007/s00161-022-01161-0,"The present study aims to formulate a new multiscale constitutive model of human trabecular bone. The trabecular bone was modelled as a nonlinear viscoelastic material. The viscoelastic effects of single trabeculae were considered by means of a hereditary integral in which stress depends on time and strain, while the elastic response was described by the hyperelastic Mooney–Rivlin model. The cuboid bone sample was extracted from the femoral head during the hip replacement surgery. The material constants in the constitutive equation were identified based on the stress relaxation test performed on the cuboid sample and the microindentation tests performed on trabeculae using the curve-fitting procedure. The microindentation tests were performed using a spherical tip instead of Vickers or Berkovich tip to minimize plastic effects during trabecular deformation. In order to validate formulated constitutive model, results from a FE simulation of stress relaxation test and uniaxial compression test were compared to the results of the corresponding experiments conducted on a macroscopic bone sample. Good agreement was observed between numerical and experimental results. The viscoelastic behaviour predicted by the proposed constitutive equation corresponds well to the response of human trabecular bone under various types of load conditions. This demonstrates the high ability of our constitutive model to simulate the behaviour of trabecular bone on a micro- and macroscopic scale. Thus, we conclude that the model, which was formulated for a single trabecula, can be successfully applied to simulate mechanical behaviour of the tissue in a macroscale. © 2022, The Author(s).",TRUE,"Deals with bone modeling, not surgery outcomes."
Skeletal muscle surrogates for the acquisition of muscle repair skills in upper limb surgery,Heskin L.; Galvin R.; Conroy J.; Traynor O.; Madden S.; Simms C.,2022,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105216,"Introduction: The required fidelity of synthetic materials in surgical simulators to teach tissue handling and repair requirements should be as accurate as possible. There is a poor understanding of the relationship between choice of muscle surrogates and training outcome for trainee surgeons. To address this, the mechanical characteristics of several candidate synthetic muscle surrogates were measured, and their subjective biofidelity was qualitatively assessed by surgeons. Methods: Silicone was selected after assessing several material options and 16 silicone-based surrogates were evaluated. Three of the closest samples to muscle (Samples 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) and one with inserted longitudinal fibres (1.2F) were mechanically tested in the following: compression and tension, needle puncture force and suture pull-out in comparison with real muscle. The four samples were evaluated by 17 Plastic and Orthopaedic surgeons to determine their views of the fidelity with regard to the handling properties, needle insertion and ease of suture pull-out. Results: The mechanical testing showed the surrogates exhibited varying characteristics that matched some of the properties of muscle, though none recreated all the mechanical characteristics of native muscle. Good biofidelity was generally achieved for compression stiffness and needle puncture force, but it was evident that tensile stiff was too low for all samples. The pull-out forces were variable and too low, except for the sample with longitudinal fibres. In the qualitative assessment, the overall median scores for the four surrogate samples were all between 30 and 32 (possible range 9–45), indicating limited differentiation of the samples tested by the surgeons. Conclusions: The surrogate materials showed a range of mechanical properties bracketing those of real muscle, thus presenting a suitable combination of candidates for use in simulators to attain the requirements as set out in the learning outcomes of muscle repair. However, despite significant mechanical differences between the samples, all surgeons found the samples to be similar to each other. © 2022",TRUE,"Focuses on surgical training tools, not on predicting or evaluating surgery results."
Biomechanical design of a new percutaneous locked plate for comminuted proximal tibia fractures,Djuricic A.; Gee A.; Schemitsch E.H.; Quenneville C.E.; Zdero R.,2022,Medical Engineering and Physics,10.1016/j.medengphy.2022.103801,"Comminuted proximal tibia fractures are an ongoing surgical challenge. This “proof of concept” study is the first step in designing a new percutaneous plate for this injury under toe-touch weight-bearing as prescribed after surgery. Finite element simulations generated design curves for overall stiffness, bone and implant stress, and interfragmentary motion using 3 fixations (no, 1, or 2 “kickstand” (KS) screws across the fracture gap) over a range of plate elastic moduli (EP = 5 to 200 GPa). Combining well-established optimization criteria to enhance callus formation (i.e. 0.2 mm ≤ axial interfragmentary motion ≤ 1 mm; shear / axial interfragmentary motion ratio < 1.6), lessen stress shielding (i.e. bone stress under the proposed plate > bone stress under a traditional titanium or steel plate), and reduce steel screw breakage (i.e. screw max stress < ultimate tensile stress of steel) resulted in plate design recommendations: 172.6 ≤ EP < 200 GPa (no KS screw), 79.8 ≤ EP < 100 GPa (1 KS screw), and 4.9 ≤ EP < 100 GPa (2 KS screws).

Efficient EndoNeRF reconstruction and its application for data-driven surgical simulation,Wang Y.; Gong B.; Long Y.; Fan S.H.; Dou Q.,2024,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-024-03114-1,"Purpose : The healthcare industry has a growing need for realistic modeling and efficient simulation of surgical scenes. With effective models of deformable surgical scenes, clinicians are able to conduct surgical planning and surgery training on scenarios close to real-world cases. However, a significant challenge in achieving such a goal is the scarcity of high-quality soft tissue models with accurate shapes and textures. To address this gap, we present a data-driven framework that leverages emerging neural radiance field technology to enable high-quality surgical reconstruction and explore its application for surgical simulations. Method : We first focus on developing a fast NeRF-based surgical scene 3D reconstruction approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance. This method can significantly outperform traditional 3D reconstruction methods, which have failed to capture large deformations and produce fine-grained shapes and textures. We then propose an automated creation pipeline of interactive surgical simulation environments through a closed mesh extraction algorithm.

We further utilize our reconstructed soft tissues to conduct FEM and MPM simulations, showcasing the practical application of our method in data-driven surgical simulations.

Assessment of Maxillary Expansion Techniques by means of 3D Elastoplastic Finite Element Static Simulation,Shosheva O.; Zhmaylo M.; Maslov L.; Borovkov A.; Vishneva N.; Lanina A.; Yaremenko A.,2025,Journal of Applied and Computational Mechanics,10.22055/jacm.2024.47055.4653,"Even though numerous studies considered various approaches for maxillary expansion, there is still no consensus on which method is optimal for a patient with a particular clinical picture. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal technique from the procedures proposed by doctors for a patient with completed facial skeleton growth. In this paper we consider four scenarios of surgical intervention, i.e., without osteotomy, midpalatal suture osteotomy, experimental osteotomy of zygomatico-alveolar ridge on the both sides of maxilla, and midpalatal suture osteotomy with osteotomy of zygomatico-alveolar ridge. In addition, two experimental appliances (one-screw expander and two-screw expander) and two positioning configurations of them (parallel to the hard palate and horizontal) are under consideration at the suggestion of the doctors. The criteria for determining the optimal technique are established in the article. Three-dimensional finite element (FE) models of skull and teeth of an adult 43-year-old patient with an ossified midpalatal suture are constructed based on the results of computed tomography, while the 3D models for the expander components are built separately and combined into the full FE system. The corresponding elastoplastic properties are adopted for the bone tissues and expander components. After proper skull fixation at the bottom, a quasi-static displacement of 0.25 mm, corresponding to quarter-turn of the control screw, is applied to the expander components to stimulate the maxillary expansion. All analyses in the paper are performed in the SIMULIA Abaqus 2021 software suite. Displacements and stresses in the bone structures of the hard palate and the appliance are obtained for all the cases studied. It was revealed that the expansion of the midpalatal suture is small in the cases without surgical intervention. A significantly greater expansion of the midpalatal suture is observed as a result of midpalatal suture osteotomy. Osteotomy of the zygomatico-alveolar ridge has virtually no effect on the value of the midpalatal suture expansion. Midpalatal suture osteotomy combined with osteotomy of the zygomatico-alveolar ridge leads to maximum expansion of the midpalatal suture. However, additional osteotomy of the zygomatico-alveolar ridge induces a proportionally greater increase in the expansion value at the dental level (by 24.8–25.8%) than at the midpalatal suture level (by 10.8–16.2%). Unlike the one-screw expander, using the two-screw expander leads to a 21.4– 22.9% greater expansion of the midpalatal suture in the cases with midpalatal suture osteotomy, but increases the highly stressed regions and the magnitude of plastic strains in them. The horizontal position of the expander contributes to a more symmetrical expansion of the maxilla than positioning the expander parallel to the palate. Based on the analysis performed, we believe that midpalatal suture osteotomy might be the best scenario for surgical intervention for maxillary expansion in patients with completed facial skeleton growth. The two-screw expander is more effective in terms of maxillary expansion values, but it increases the risk of bone resorption. It is also found that providing osteotomy of zygomatico-alveolar ridge and changing the position of the expander practically does not affect the expansion state. Thus, our findings can serve as a basis for doctors deciding which scenario of surgical intervention and expander configuration would be more appropriate for a particular patient. © 2024 Published by Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical simulation, not on predicting or evaluating aesthetics in surgery."

The computational model used in this analysis was created from an unknown patient dataset available in the Embodi3d online library. The segmentation, three-dimensional reconstruction, and modeling of the structures involved were performed using Materialise Mimics and Rhino3D. The FDP tendon excursion and stress values present in the model were calculated in the ANSYS environment. Based on the finite-element simulation, the FDP tendon presents an excursion of 10.1 mm during passive postoperative flexion. The highest-stress values were observed between the pulleys-FDP tendon contact surfaces. In particular, the pulley A1 exhibited the maximum principal stress of the model with a 58.7 MPa. The pulley A3 showed the same stress distribution pattern that A1 Pulley, but with the lowest values. The FDP Tendon excursion obtained is consistent with the results reported in the literature, which vary from 8 to 11 mm. The stress values found in the model explain the importance of the pulley mechanism keeping the FDP tendon attached to the finger bone during the range of motion experienced.

Defining a general configuration for rhombic flaps, the surgical process of wound closure is simulated for a wide variety of patterns. To address the intrinsic uncertainties associated with modelling skin's mechanical properties, four different sets of material parameters are considered, to investigate statistical measures. The results suggest that implementing the rhombic flap technique in a way similar to Z-plasty leads to an optimized surgical technique. The proposed flap, which can be employed for 60° to 90° rhombic defects, can reduce the maximum von Mises stress by 53% (on average) with respect to the Dufourmentel flap, and, in the case of a 60° defect, 43% with respect to the Limberg flap. To avoid any depressed area such as dog-ear formation, the maximum compressive principal stress is examined to assure that it remains within the limits of the stresses in the existing surgical techniques. The deformed configuration is also taken into consideration.

To explore the possible correlations between anatomy and implant performance, response surface models for micromotion metrics were constructed. Detailed morphological analyses were conducted and a clear nonlinear decreasing trend was observed between implant average micromotion and both the metaphyseal canal flare indices and average densities in Gruen zones. The present study demonstrates that the primary stability and tolerance of the short stem to variability in patient anatomy were high, reducing the need for patient stratification.

Optimization of reconstruction of 2D medical images based on computer 3D reconstruction technology,Liu S.; Peng J.,2015,Journal of Digital Information Management,,"Computer 3D reconstruction consisting of reconstruction of 3D point clouds and images plays an important role in computer graphics, computer image processing and computer vision research. Image based 3D reconstruction includes reconstruction of single image and multiple images. Compared to obtain 3D mode by modeling software or scan tester traditionally, image-based 3D reconstruction is featured by strong sense of reality, low cost, vivid image and broader market demand. Moreover, image-based 3D reconstruction is practically an inverse problem of computer graphics. In medical field, 3D reconstruction of medical images is to create 3D information based on a 2D image and then form a vivid 3D image. It transforms 2D fault data sequence obtained from Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) into 3D data, which is valuable in demonstrating tissues and organs of human body. 3D reconstruction technology concerning medicine is widely applied in medical diagnosis, surgical planning, analog simulation and plastic surgery. Therefore, computer 3D reconstruction technology is of important academic and practical value to reconstruction of 2D medical images. Research of 3D reconstruction of medical images focuses on preprocessing of medical images, such as filtering and interpolation, and segmentation and extraction of tissue and organ. This study analyzes design concept and method of cross-platform medical image 3D reconstruction system, development status, market demand and prospect of computer 3D reconstruction technology, medical volume data visualization technology, acquisition of medical images and several kinds of medical image preprocessing technologies. In the study, region growing algorithm is used to segment liver tissues. Volume rendering technology provides 3D special description for 2D medical fault images, to make its internal 3D structure become clearer.

New synthetic mitral valve model for human prolapsed mitral valve reconstructive surgery for training,Goode D.; Mohammadi S.; Taheri R.; Mohammadi H.,2020,Journal of Medical Engineering and Technology,10.1080/03091902.2020.1753837,"The training process of young surgeons is highly desirable in order for them to gain an understanding of the quality of care and patient safety required during cardiac surgeries, however, it may take a few years of practice in order for them to properly develop these skills. Artificial life-like platforms and models are extremely recommended for teaching hands-on and real-world practice in both junior and even experienced medical professionals and surgeons. Suitable and accessible training tools are of significant importance for simulating a particular surgery in order to provide practice opportunities for a specific surgical procedure. In this study, we focussed on the simulation of the human mitral valve prolapse reconstructive surgery. An innovative, artificial, biomimetic model was designed and fabricated made of Cryogel biomaterial developed in our lab that is suitable for the precise practice on the mitral valve prolapse model. The proposed model is mainly made up of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) cryogel, which is designed to resemble the geometric and mechanical properties of a diseased (prolapse) mitral valve.

Fluid dynamic assessment of tracheal flow in infants with congenital tracheal stenosis before and after surgery,Takeishi N.; Miki T.; Otani T.; Ii S.; Morita K.; Wada S.,2019,Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing,10.1007/s11517-018-1928-7,"Tracheal flow in infants with congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) was numerically investigated using subject-specific airway models before and after reconstructive surgery. We quantified tracheal flow based on airway resistance during inhalation, and compared it between controls and patients before and after surgery. The airway resistance in each subject was assessed using geometrical parameters of the trachea: the minimum cross-sectional area Amin, the minimum cross-sectional area normalized by the standard deviation of the cross-sectional area Amin/σA, the area ratio of the minimum and maximum cross-sectional area Amin/Amax, and ratio of the normalized standard deviation of cross-sectional area to the mean cross-sectional area σA/Amean. Our numerical results demonstrated that such geometrical parameters could be used to assess the severity of CTS. Since subjects can be more clearly categorized as controls and most preoperative patients in terms of the airway resistance, a simulation using subject-specific airway models can lead us to a precise understanding of tracheal flow, and also provide knowledge about therapeutic decision. Our numerical results also demonstrated that significant surgical expansion of cross-sectional area did not help recover tracheal flow because of expansion loss. These results will be helpful not only when making therapeutic decisions about surgery but also when assessing quality of life in postoperative patients.

3D surgical planning in patients affected by lipodystrophy,Pérez-Carrasco J.A.; Acha B.; Gómez-Cia T.; Lopez-Garcia R.A.; Delgado C.; Serrano C.,2015,Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics,10.1016/j.compmedimag.2014.12.007,"Lipodystrophy is a pathological condition characterized by the focal or general absence of adipose tissue. Surgeons reset the patient's surface contours using injectable materials to recreate a normal physical appearance. However, due to difficulties in preoperative planning and intraoperative assessment, about 15% of the surgical procedures involved are reinterventions to improve volume or symmetry. This increases the need for an available, efficient tool capable of providing the surgeon with a good estimation of the volumes to be injected before the intervention proper begins. This work describes a virtual reality-based application for the surgical planning of facial lipodystrophy correction (FLIC). The tool uses points selected interactively by the surgeon to compute a curve that delimits the surface area to be operated on. It then automatically computes an estimated natural reconstructed surface and the quantity of volume that needs to be implanted during the intervention. Experiments have been carried out in which the filling volumes estimated using FLIC and ZBrush software were compared with the real volumes injected by the surgeon. ICCs higher than 0.97 indicate that there were no significant differences between the respective measurements, thus validating the tool proposed in this paper. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",TRUE,"Focuses on 3D planning, not on automatic outcome prediction."
Accurate and robust reconstruction of a surface model of the proximal femur from sparse-point data and a dense-point distribution model for surgical navigation,Zheng G.; Dong X.; Rajamani K.T.; Zhang X.; Styner M.; Thoranaghatte R.U.; Nolte L.-P.; Gonzalez Ballester M.A.,2007,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2007.895736,"Constructing a 3-D surface model from sparse-point data is a nontrivial task. Here, we report an accurate and robust approach for reconstructing a surface model of the proximal femur from sparse-point data and a dense-point distribution model (DPDM). The problem is formulated as a three-stage optimal estimation process. The first stage, affine registration, is to iteratively estimate a scale and a rigid transformation between the mean surface model of the DPDM and the sparse input points. The estimation results of the first stage are used to establish point correspondences for the second stage, statistical instantiation, which stably instantiates a surface model from the DPDM using a statistical approach. This surface model is then fed to the third stage, kernel-based deformation, which further refines the surface model. Handling outliers is achieved by consistently employing the least trimmed squares (LTS) approach with a roughly estimated outlier rate in all three stages. If an optimal value of the outlier rate is preferred, we propose a hypothesis testing procedure to automatically estimate it. We present here our validations using four experiments, which include 1) leave-one-out experiment, 2) experiment on evaluating the present approach for handling pathology, 3) experiment on evaluating the present approach for handling outliers, and 4) experiment on reconstructing surface models of seven dry cadaver femurs using clinically relevant data without noise and with noise added. Our validation results demonstrate the robust performance of the present approach in handling outliers, pathology, and noise.

Simulation of heat distribution and thermal damage patterns of diode hair-removal lasers: An applicable method for optimizing treatment parameters,Ataie-Fashtami L.; Shirkavand A.; Sarkar S.; Alinaghizadeh M.; Hejazi M.; Fateh M.; Esmaeeli Djavid G.; Zand N.; Mohammadreza H.,2011,Photomedicine and Laser Surgery,10.1089/pho.2010.2895,"Objective: We simulated the heat distribution and thermal damage patterns of diode hair-removal lasers for different spot sizes, pulse durations, and fluences as a guide for optimization. Background: Recently, the concept of thermal damage time as a reference for pulse duration has become a subject of debate. Methods: Laser-Induced-Temperature-Calculation-In-Tissue (LITCIT) was used for the simulations. Skin was modeled as two homogenous layers of epidermis/dermis and two coaxial cylinders as the hair shaft/ follicle. Opto-thermal coefficients of the components and the radiant parameters of the laser (diode, 810 nm) were defined. Results: At constant fluences and pulse durations, the damage occurred deeper when larger spot sizes were used. At constant pulse duration, high fluences caused significant damage to the hair follicle and epidermis. By using longer pulse durations (≤400 ms) at constant fluences, there was more effective damage to the hair follicle while sparing the adjacent epidermis and dermis. Because of the time-dependent temperature profiles, an increased pulse duration creates a moderate, gradual rise in the target's temperature. Pulse durations >400 ms are accompanied by unwanted dermis damage. Conclusions: Our results show that using very long pulse durations near the tissue damage time (≤400 ms) creates better efficacy in treating unwanted hairs while avoiding unwanted damage. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011.",TRUE,"Focuses on laser hair removal, not on predicting or evaluating surgery results."
Influence of halogen irradiance on short- and long-term wear resistance of resin-based composite materials,Bhamra G.S.; Fleming G.J.P.,2009,Dental Materials,10.1016/j.dental.2008.06.007,"Objective: The Oregon Health Science University (OHSU) four-chamber oral wear simulator was used to examine the impact of halogen irradiance on the short- and long-term wear behavior of four-methacrylate resin-based composites (RBCs). The hypothesis proposed was that exacerbated wear would occur following the long-term wear of RBCs irradiated under non-optimized irradiance conditions. Methods: Disc-shaped specimens (12.0 ± 0.1 mm diameter and 2.0 ± 0.1 mm height) of each RBC were prepared at irradiances of 650 ± 14, 530 ± 8, 420 ± 14, 350 ± 8, 270 ± 8, 230 ± 14, 190 ± 8, and 150 ± 8 mW/cm2, respectively. Short-term three-body wear simulation was carried out for 50,000 cycles and long-term was performed up to 500,000 cycles. The wear facets were analyzed using a non-contact optical profilometer. One-, two-, and three-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were made at P = 0.05, guided as necessary by Tukeys correction in multiple partial analyses of the mean total volumetric wear and mean maximum wear depth. Results: For the short-term wear resistance, the two-way ANOVA identified no significant difference in the mean total volumetric wear (P = 0.188) although the mean total wear depth was identified to be significant (P = 0.024). The long-term wear resistance for the mean total volumetric wear identified significant differences for each RBC at varying irradiances with the number of cycles but not for the mean maximum wear depth. Significance: The increased number of ploughing actions of the antagonist on the RBC (long-term) results in increased friction which would be expected to play a major role in the wear process. The significant increase in the mean total volumetric wear, but not the mean maximum wear depth, observed over time which is exacerbated at reduced halogen irradiances emphasizes the arguments of DeLong for the employment of volume for evaluating material loss due to wear following in vitro wear simulation of RBCs. © 2008 Academy of Dental Materials.",TRUE,"Covers dental material durability, not surgery results prediction."
Prediction of permanent deformation in cast clasps for denture prostheses using a validated nonlinear finite element model,Mahmoud A.A.A.; Wakabayashi N.; Takahashi H.,2007,Dental Materials,10.1016/j.dental.2005.10.012,"Objectives: Permanent deformation is one of the most common mechanical complications that affect denture clasps. This can lead to loss of retention and stability of the prosthesis. The purpose of this study was to apply and validate a nonlinear finite element model for permanent deformation prediction in cast denture clasps. Such a model can enhance the process of design optimization and contribute to minimizing the possibility of this problem. Methods: Cast clasps made from Ti-6Al-7Nb, Co-Cr and Type IV gold alloys were loaded in three different directions (outside, inside and outside inclined 30°), and the resulting permanent deformation values were recorded. Nonlinear finite element analysis simulations based on the maximum distortion energy criterion for yielding, were conducted for clasp models that were reproduced according to the dimensions of each experimental specimen. Linear regression analysis for the results of the experiment and simulation was performed to verify the validity of the mathematical models. Results: Deflections required to produce specific amounts of permanent deformation were in close agreement with those recorded experimentally. The R2 value for all bending tests was 0.985 and the linear regression equation expressed in micrometers was [DeflectionFEA = 0.976 (DeflectionReal) + 34].

Modelling of experimentally created partial-thickness human skin burns and subsequent therapeutic cooling: A new measure for cooling effectiveness,Van de Sompel D.; Kong T.Y.; Ventikos Y.,2009,Medical Engineering and Physics,10.1016/j.medengphy.2008.11.016,"Rapid post-injury cooling of a skin burn has been shown to have both symptomatic and therapeutic benefits. However, the latter cannot be explained by temperature reduction alone, and must thus be secondary to an altered biological response. In this study, we construct a computational model to calculate the heat transfer and damage accumulation in human skin during and after a burn. This enables us to assess the effectiveness of various cooling protocols (involving both free and forced convection to air and water respectively) in terms of their reduction in Arrhenius tissue damage. In this process, we propose an extension of the Arrhenius damage model in the form of a new measure ξ, which estimates the relevance of post-burn accrued damage. It was found that the reduction in Arrhenius damage integrals near the skin surface was too small to be physiologically relevant. Hence our results confirm that while the reduction in tissue temperatures is indeed quicker, the therapeutic benefit of cooling cannot be explained by thermal arguments (i.e. based on Arrhenius damage models) alone. We plan to validate this hypothesis by conducting future microarray analyses of differential gene expression in cooled and non-cooled burn lesions.

Mathematical modeling of laser lipolysis,Mordon S.R.; Wassmer B.; Reynaud J.P.; Zemmouri J.,2008,BioMedical Engineering Online,10.1186/1475-925X-7-10,"Background and Objectives: Liposuction continues to be one of the most popular procedures performed in cosmetic surgery. As the public's demand for body contouring continues, laser lipolysis has been proposed to improve results, minimize risk, optimize patient comfort, and reduce the recovery period. Mathematical modeling of laser lipolysis could provide a better understanding of the laser lipolysis process and could determine the optimal dosage as a function of fat volume to be removed. Study design/Materials and Methods: An Optical-Thermal-Damage Model was formulated using finite-element modeling software (Femlab 3.1, Comsol Inc). The general model simulated light distribution using the diffusion approximation of the transport theory, temperature rise using the bioheat equation and laser-induced injury using the Arrhenius damage model. Biological tissue was represented by two homogenous regions (dermis and fat layer) with a nonlinear air-tissue boundary condition including free convection. Video recordings were used to gain a better understanding of the back and forth movement of the cannula during laser lipolysis in order to consider them in our mathematical model. Infrared video recordings were also performed in order to compare the actual surface temperatures to our calculations. The reduction in fat volume was determined as a function of the total applied energy and subsequently compared to clinical data reported in the literature. Results: In patients, when using cooled tumescent anesthesia, 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser or 980 nm diode laser: (6 W, back and forth motion: 100 mm/s) give similar skin surface temperature (max: 41°C). These measurements are in accordance with those obtained by mathematical modeling performed with a 1 mm cannula inserted inside the hypodermis layer at 0.8 cm below the surface. Similarly, the fat volume reduction observed in patients at 6-month follow up can be determined by mathematical modeling. This fat reduction depends on the applied energy, typically 5 cm3 for 3000 J. At last, skin retraction was observed in patients at 6-month follow up. This observation can be easily explained by mathematical modeling showing that the temperature increase inside the lower dermis is sufficient (48-50°C) to induce skin tightening Discussion and Conclusion: Laser lipolysis can be described by a theoretical model. Fat volume reduction observed in patients is in accordance with model calculations. Due to heat diffusion, temperature elevation is also produced inside the lower reticular dermis. This interesting observation can explain remodeling of the collagenous tissue, with clinically evident skin tightening. In conclusion, while the heat generated by interstitial laser irradiation provides stimulate lipolysis of the fat cells, the collagen and elastin are also stimulated resulting in a tightening in the skin. This mathematical model should serve as a useful tool to simulate and better understand the mechanism of action of the laser lipolysis. © 2008 Mordon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",TRUE,"Focuses on math models, not on predicting or evaluating looks."

Growth on demand: Reviewing the mechanobiology of stretched skin,Zöllner A.M.; Holland M.A.; Honda K.S.; Gosain A.K.; Kuhl E.,2013,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2013.03.018,"Skin is a highly dynamic, autoregulated, living system that responds to mechanical stretch through a net gain in skin surface area. Tissue expansion uses the concept of controlled overstretch to grow extra skin for defect repair in situ. While the short-term mechanics of stretched skin have been studied intensely by testing explanted tissue samples ex vivo, we know very little about the long-term biomechanics and mechanobiology of living skin in vivo. Here we explore the long-term effects of mechanical stretch on the characteristics of living skin using a mathematical model for skin growth. We review the molecular mechanisms by which skin responds to mechanical loading and model their effects collectively in a single scalar-valued internal variable, the surface area growth. This allows us to adopt a continuum model for growing skin based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into a reversible elastic and an irreversible growth part. To demonstrate the inherent modularity of this approach, we implement growth as a user-defined constitutive subroutine into the general purpose implicit finite element program Abaqus/Standard. To illustrate the features of the model, we simulate the controlled area growth of skin in response to tissue expansion with multiple filling points in time. Our results demonstrate that the field theories of continuum mechanics can reliably predict the manipulation of thin biological membranes through mechanical overstretch. Our model could serve as a valuable tool to rationalize clinical process parameters such as expander geometry, expander size, filling volume, filling pressure, and inflation timing to minimize tissue necrosis and maximize patient comfort in plastic and reconstructive surgery. While initially developed for growing skin, our model can easily be generalized to arbitrary biological structures to explore the physiology and pathology of stretch-induced growth of other living systems such as hearts, arteries, bladders, intestines, ureters, muscles, and nerves. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",TRUE,"Talks about skin growth modeling, not surgery aesthetics prediction."

Thermal damage patterns of diode hair-removal lasers according to various skin types and hair densities and colors: A simulation study,Shirkavand A.; Ataie-Fashtami L.; Sarkar S.; Alinaghizadeh M.R.; Fateh M.; Zand N.; Djavid G.E.,2012,Photomedicine and Laser Surgery,10.1089/pho.2011.3152,"Background and objective: It is important to prevent unwanted side effects of diode hair-removal lasers especially in dark skin tones. This study simulates the thermal damage patterns caused by diode hair-removal lasers in different skin types, hair colors, and hair densities. Materials and methods: LITCIT software has been used with the tissue modeled as two components, the skin and the hair. The absorption coefficients of various skin types (f mel=5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), laser parameters, and optothermal properties of tissue were inputs. Results: For all skin types there was a significant unwanted thermal damage to the epidermis as a result of fluence increase. Using longer pulse durations is accompanied by effective thermal damage to the hair follicle, while preserving the epidermis in skin types II and III, an effect not achieved in darker skins. Regardless of pulse duration, when the distance between hair follicles is ≤0.5 mm, there is a significant increase in thermal damage to interfollicular epidermis with high fluences compared with lower hair densities (interfollicular space≥1 mm). In lighter hairs, while using longer pulse durations, higher fluences are needed in order to obtain the same level of thermal damage in the hair follicle as shorter pulse widths. Conclusions: In lighter skin types, lengthening the pulse duration of diode lasers (up to 400 ms) increases efficacy while preserving epidermis from unwanted thermal damage. However, it is necessary to use lower fluences while using longer pulse duration to avoid irreversible thermal damage to epidermis in darker tones, as is also true for locations with higher hair densities. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",TRUE,"Focuses on laser hair removal damage, not surgery outcome prediction."

To improve the color perception, the inhomogeneous morphology of the native tooth can be imitated by layering two optically different restorative materials. However until now the benefit of this method has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Methods: The optical parameters, absorption coefficient μa, scattering coefficient μs, anisotropy factor g and effective scattering coefficient μ′s, were determined for the enamel and dentin material of the restorative material systems Artemis® and Herculite XRV®. This was carried out for each material system in the wavelength range between 400 and 700 nm using integrating sphere measurements followed by inverse Monte Carlo simulations. Results: Using the optical parameters and a forward Monte Carlo simulation, the color perception of layered samples could be predicted with a sufficient degree of accuracy. The total color impression was shown to be dependent on the sample thickness and the transparency/translucency of the single layers of enamel and dentin materials. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that the use of two materials is well-suited for the restoration of front teeth with their relatively high proportion of enamel.

Design/methodology/approach - A patient with mandible defect underwent reconstruction using custom-made implant. 3D models of the patient's skull are generated based on computed tomography image data. After evaluation of the 3D reconstructed image, it was identified that some bone fragment was moved due to the missing segment.

Empirical relationship between lengthening an anterior cruciate ligament graft and increases in knee anterior laxity: A human cadaveric study,Grover D.; Thompson D.; Hull M.L.; Howell S.M.,2006,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.2378931,"Lengthening of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft construct can occur as a result of lengthening at the sites of tibial and/or femoral fixation and manifests as an increase in anterior laxity. Although lengthening at the site of fixation has been measured for a variety of fixation devices, it is difficult to place these results in a clinical context because the mathematical relationship between lengthening of an ACL graft construct and anterior laxity is unknown. The purpose of our study was to determine empirically this relationship. Ten cadaveric knees were reconstructed with a double-looped tendon graft. With the knee in 25° of flexion, the position of the proximal end of the graft inside the femoral tunnel was adjusted by moving the femoral fixation device until the anterior laxity at an applied anterior force of 134 N matched that of the intact knee. In random order, the graft construct was lengthened 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mm by moving the femoral fixation device distally along the femoral tunnel and anterior laxity was measured. The increase in the length of the graft construct was related to the increase in anterior laxity by a simple linear regression model. Lengthening the graft construct from 1 to 5 mm caused an equal increase in anterior laxity (slope = 1.0 mm/mm, r2=0.800, p<0.0001). Because an anterior laxity increase of 3 mm or greater in a reconstructed knee is considered unstable clinically and because many fixation devices in widespread use clinically allow 3 mm or greater of lengthening in in vitro tests, our empirical relationship indicates that lengthening at the site of fixation probably is an important cause of knee instability following ACL reconstructive surgery. Our empirical relation also indicates that an important criterion in the design of future fixation devices is that lengthening at the sites affixation in in vitro tests should be limited to less than 3 mm.

Biomechanical comparison of three second-generation reconstruction nails in an unstable subtrochanteric femur fracture model,Heiney J.; Battula S.; Njus G.; Ruble C.; Vrabec G.,2008,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine",10.1243/09544119JEIM369,"The purpose of this study is to determine if a biomechanical difference exists in dynamic stiffness, fatigue life, and fracture site displacement by comparing three cephalomedullary reconstruction nails. An examination was made of the Biomet Uniflex reconstruction nail, the Biomet Vector nail, and the Stryker Howmedica Long Gamma nail in the fixation of an unstable subtrochanteric femur fracture model, using a synthetic bone model. Mean stiffness for each nail was initially determined in control specimens (i.e. no fracture and no instrumentation). The nail stiffness values were 1764.0N/mm (controls), 373.61N/mm (Uniflex), 294.27N/mm (vector), and 656.36N/mm (Gamma). The Gamma was statistically stiffer than the Uniflex and Vector (p<0.002). Mean fatigue life measurements were: Uniflex at 52 891 cycles, failing at the most distal of the proximal two screw holes; Vector at 45 344 cycles, failing in the nail at the level of the fracture site; Gamma at 88 748 cycles failing at the lag screw hole. The p value between the Gamma and Vector was less than 0.01 and between Gamma and Uniflex was less than 0.05. The mean maximal axial displacement at the fracture site was 2.448 mm, 2.305 mm, and 0.790 mm for the Uniflex, Vector and Gamma, respectively. The p value between the Gamma and the other nails was <0.01. The mean maximal transverse displacement at the fracture site was 1.223 mm, 1.197 mm, and 0.280 mm respectively. The p value between the Long Gamma and the other two nails was <0.01. In conclusion, the Long Gamma nail demonstrated statistically significant fixation superiority in stiffness, resistance to fatigue, and fracture site displacement compared to the Uniflex and Vector nails.

Modeling the forces of cutting with scissors,Mahvash M.; Voo L.M.; Kim D.; Jeung K.; Wainer J.; Okamura A.M.,2008,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2007.908069,"Modeling forces applied to scissors during cutting of biological materials is useful for surgical simulation. Previous approaches to haptic display of scissor cutting are based on recording and replaying measured data. This paper presents an analytical model based on the concepts of contact mechanics and fracture mechanics to calculate forces applied to scissors during cutting of a slab of material. The model considers the process of cutting as a sequence of deformation and fracture phases. During deformation phases, forces applied to the scissors are calculated from a torque-angle response model synthesized from measurement data multiplied by a ratio that depends on the position of the cutting crack edge and the curve of the blades. Using the principle of conservation of energy, the forces of fracture are related to the fracture toughness of the material and the geometry of the blades of the scissors. The forces applied to scissors generally include high-frequency fluctuations. We show that the analytical model accurately predicts the average applied force. The cutting model is computationally efficient, so it can be used for real-time computations such as haptic rendering. Experimental results from cutting samples of paper, plastic, cloth, and chicken skin confirm the model, and the model is rendered in a haptic virtual environment. © 2006 IEEE.",TRUE,Models scissor cutting forces but skips predicting or evaluating surgery aesthetics—out of scope.
Constitutive models for constrained compression of unimpacted and impacted human morselized bone grafts,Lunde K.B.; Foss O.A.; Fosse L.; Skallerud B.,2008,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.2979878,"Morselized corticocancellous bone (MCB) is widely used in revision surgery with and without impaction. In the current study material parameters for the nonlinear viscoelastic and plastic responses of impacted and unimpacted human MCBs were determined during constrained compression. These models may be useful in finite element analyses of surgical constructs involving impacted and unimpacted MCBs. MCB is impacted layer by layer in the femoral canal during revision surgery. The influence of different layers on the mechanical properties was therefore also examined by comparing the relaxation strength and elastic and plastic strains for bone pellets impacted in one and two layers during constrained compression of human MCB. The relaxation strength was found to increase significantly by 14% for two layer pellets compared to one layer pellets, and the plastic strains decreased significantly by 15%, while the elastic strains were similar.

Analysis of thermal stress in cryosurgery of kidneys,He X.; Bischof J.C.,2005,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,10.1115/1.1934021,"In this study, the thermal stress distribution in cryosurgery of kidney was investigated using a multiphysics finite element model developed in ANSYS (V8.1). The thermal portion of the model was verified using experimental data and the mechanics portion of the model (elastic) was verified using classic analytical solutions. Temperature dependent thermal and mechanical properties were used in the model. Moreover, the model accounts for thermal expansion due to both thermal expansion in single phase and volumetric expansion associated with phase change of tissue water to ice. For a clinical cylindrical cryoprobe inserted into the renal cortex from the top-middle renal capsule, it was found that the thermal stress distributions along the radial position are very different at different depths from the top renal capsule. The thermal stress is much higher at both ends than in the middle of the cryoprobe surface. It was found that there might be more tissue next to the top renal capsule than other region undergoing microcrack formation or plastic deformation. Furthermore, it was found that macrocrack formation is more likely to occur in tissue adjacent to the cryoprobe surface (especially on the sharp point tip) and during the thawing phase of cryosurgery. It was further found that the volumetric expansion associated with phase change induced much higher thermal stress than thermal expansion in a single phase and might therefore be the main cause of the frequently observed crack formation shortly after initiation of thawing in cryosurgery. Because the thermal stress adjacent to the cryoprobe is much higher than the yield stress of frozen renal tissue, a plastic stress model is required for better modeling of the thermal stress distribution in cryosurgery of kidney in future. However the computational effort will then be drastically increased due to the strong nonlinear nature of the plastic model and more experimental studies are indispensable for better understanding of the mechanical behavior of frozen tissue in cryosurgery.

A three-dimensional finite element stress analysis for tunnel placement and buttons in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions,Au A.G.; Raso V.J.; Liggins A.B.; Otto D.D.; Amirfazli A.,2005,Journal of Biomechanics,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.05.007,"This communication reports the results of a three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of stresses in a surgically altered femur and tibia. The model incorporated a novel approach in implementing orthotropic and inhomogeneous bone properties and non-uniform distributed loading. Cortical, cancellous, and subchondral bone of the femur and the tibia were modeled. Mechanical properties for the cortical and cancellous bone were mapped from published data characterizing the anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the bone properties. Mesh adequacy was determined using stress convergence and strain energy error convergence. Qualitatively, the results of the study compare well with experimental principal compressive strains from the literature. With respect to tunnel placement in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the model predicted stress-shielding at the postero-lateral region of the tunnel wall, and increased stress at the postero-medial region of the tunnel wall. The stresses in the cancellous bone beneath the tunnel were, in general, lower than those above the tunnel. Prolonged stress shielding leads to bone resorption of the posterior tunnel wall leading to tunnel enlargement, and possible compromise of the ACL reconstruction. The stresses on the femoral cortex produced from a button-type fixation were noticeable for low levels of loading; the stress levels were very similar in models incorporating bone properties of patients aged 45 and 65. Repeated compression of the femoral cortex at these stress levels may cause microdamage to the cortex eventually resulting in fatigue failure. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The pre-selection of a donor site depends primarily on the morphological fit of the available bone mass and the shape of the part that has to be transplanted. To achieve sufficient incorporation of the autograft into the host bone, precise planning and simulation of the surgical intervention based on three-dimensional CT studies is required. This paper presents a method to identify an optimal donor site by performing an optimization of appropriate similarity measures between donor region and a given transplant. At the initial stage the surgeon has to delineate the osteotomy border lines in the template CT data set and to define a set of constraints for the optimization task in the donor site CT data set. The following fully automatic optimization stage delivers a set of sub-optimal and optimal donor sites for a given template. All generated solutions can be explored interactively on the computer display using an efficient graphical interface. Reconstructive operations supported by our system were performed on 28 patients.

The considered system is composed of a fixture, an abutment and a connecting screw. We analysed the behaviour of the implant system considering three different designs of the fixture, in order to establish which one provides the better mechanical behaviour. After the definition of the numerical models, loading conditions were selected in order to reproduce the same stress state found in previous mechanical failure tests. Preloading and functional loading conditions were simulated. The analysis of the numerical results shows that the structure yielding is due to the fixture neck plastic deformation, that increases the load eccentricity and then the bending stress on the connecting screw. Only slight differences were found between the three implant systems in the amount and distribution of stress. The model reproduces properly the implant systems and the experimental set-up. The goodness of the model can be summarised as: realistic geometrical structure, elastoplastic model for the material description, correct definition of the contacts and the existing tolerance among the different system components, reproduction of the preloading stress condition.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Glyaderm® in a single-stage bilayered skin reconstruction procedure compared to the standard split-thickness skin graft (STSG) alone in acute burn wounds.  Methods: In this intra-individual randomized controlled trial, 20 patients with acute burn wounds requiring skin grafting were enrolled. Each patient received both treatments: Glyaderm® combined with STSG on one wound area and STSG alone on a comparable wound area. Scar quality was assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) and objective measurements including elasticity and colorimetry.  Results: The Glyaderm® plus STSG group demonstrated significantly improved scar quality compared to the STSG alone group at all time points. POSAS scores indicated better vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, and pliability in the Glyaderm® group. Objective measurements confirmed increased elasticity and more normal skin color in the Glyaderm® treated areas. No significant differences in graft take or complication rates were observed between groups.  Conclusions: Single-stage bilayered skin reconstruction using Glyaderm® as an acellular dermal regeneration template combined with STSG results in improved scar quality compared to STSG alone in acute burn wounds.

Traditional planning methods rely on two-dimensional radiographs, which may not accurately represent the three-dimensional nature of the deformity. This study presents a computer-assisted, patient-specific three-dimensional planning method for single-cut rotational osteotomy.

The method allows precise preoperative planning and evaluation of the osteotomy, potentially improving surgical outcomes. The approach was validated on clinical cases, demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy in correcting complex deformities.

Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) microspheres/liquid poly(dimethylsiloxane) composition for correction of small defects in face: Histological evaluation in animal experiment,Horák D.; Adamyan A.; Golubeva O.; Skuba N.; Vinokurova T.,2006,Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine,,"Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) microspheres suspended in liquid poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) were evaluated as a filler material for correction of small defects in the face. The composition was injected subcutaneously into the backs of rabbits and histologically examined at 1, 3, and 6 months post-injection. The pHEMA microspheres were well tolerated, with minimal inflammatory response and no evidence of migration. The PDMS carrier provided a suitable vehicle for injection and maintained the microspheres at the injection site. The results suggest that pHEMA microspheres in liquid PDMS may be a promising material for soft tissue augmentation in facial reconstructive surgery.",TRUE,"Focuses on animal material testing, not on automatic aesthetic prediction."

Registration of different phases of contrast-enhanced CT/MRI data for computer-assisted liver surgery planning: Evaluation of state-of-the-art methods,Lange T.; Wenckebach T.H.; Lamecker H.; Seebass M.; Hünerbein M.; Eulenstein S.; Gebauer B.; Schlag P.M.,2005,International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,"Accurate registration of different phases of contrast-enhanced CT/MRI data is essential for computer-assisted liver surgery planning. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art registration methods for aligning multiphase contrast-enhanced liver images. We compare intensity-based and feature-based approaches, assessing their accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency on clinical datasets. Our results demonstrate that while intensity-based methods achieve higher accuracy in homogeneous regions, feature-based methods offer better performance in areas with significant anatomical changes due to contrast enhancement. The study provides insights into the strengths and limitations of current registration techniques, guiding the selection of appropriate methods for clinical applications in liver surgery planning.",TRUE,"Focuses on liver surgery, not aesthetic outcome prediction."
Evaluation of microleakage of composite resin restorations by an electrochemical technique: The impedance methodology,Pradelle-Plasse N.; Wenger F.; Picard B.; Colon P.,2004,Dental Materials,,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the microleakage of composite resin restorations by an electrochemical technique, the impedance methodology. Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surfaces of 30 extracted human premolars and restored with a composite resin. The specimens were subjected to thermocycling and then immersed in an electrolyte solution. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to assess the microleakage at the tooth-restoration interface. The results showed that the impedance values correlated with the degree of microleakage, indicating that the EIS technique is a sensitive and non-destructive method for evaluating the sealing ability of composite resin restorations. This method could be a valuable tool for in vitro studies of restorative materials and techniques.",TRUE,Mismatch with plastic or oncological surgery topics.

The cytocompatibility of these PUs was evaluated using fibroblast cell cultures, and their antibacterial properties were assessed against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Results demonstrated that the PUs supported fibroblast adhesion and proliferation, indicating good cytocompatibility. Additionally, the PUs exhibited inhibitory effects on staphylococcal growth, suggesting potential for reducing bacterial colonization. These findings highlight the promise of biodegradable PUs for biomedical applications requiring both tissue compatibility and resistance to bacterial infection.",TRUE,"Title's about material safety, not surgery results prediction."

Non-decay type fast-setting calcium phosphate cement: Setting behaviour in calf serum and its tissue response,Miyamoto Y.; Ishikawa K.; Takechi M.; Yuasa M.; Kon M.; Nagayama M.; Asaoka K.,1996,Biomaterials,Elsevier Science Ltd,The setting behaviour of a non-decay type fast-setting calcium phosphate cement (CPC) was investigated in calf serum and its tissue response was evaluated in vivo. The cement was prepared by mixing tetracalcium phosphate and dicalcium phosphate anhydrous powders with a 2% sodium phosphate solution. The setting time of the cement in calf serum was significantly shorter than that in distilled water. The compressive strength of the cement set in calf serum was also higher than that set in distilled water. Histological examination after implantation in rat femurs showed that the cement was biocompatible and was gradually resorbed and replaced by new bone tissue. These results suggest that the non-decay type fast-setting CPC has potential for clinical applications as a bone substitute material.,TRUE,"Focuses on bone cement materials, not surgery outcome prediction."

Failure mode of dental restorative materials under Hertzian indentation,Wang Y.; Darvell B.W.,2007,Dental Materials,,"The failure mode of dental restorative materials under Hertzian indentation was investigated to understand their mechanical behavior and durability. Using a spherical indenter, various dental restorative materials were subjected to controlled loading to simulate occlusal contact stresses. The study analyzed crack initiation and propagation patterns, identifying critical stress thresholds leading to material failure. Results indicated that brittle materials exhibited cone cracking and radial cracking, while more resilient composites showed different failure mechanisms. These findings provide insights into the design and selection of restorative materials with improved resistance to occlusal forces, contributing to enhanced clinical performance and longevity of dental restorations.",TRUE,"Focuses on dental material failure, not on predicting or evaluating surgery aesthetics."
