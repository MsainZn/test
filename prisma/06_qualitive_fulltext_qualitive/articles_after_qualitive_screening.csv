Cosmetic outcome assessment following breast-conserving therapy: a comparison between BCCT. core software and panel evaluation,"Haloua, Max Hendrik and Krekel, Nicole Marianna Alexandra and Jacobs, Gerrit Johannes Albertus and Zonderhuis, Barbara and Bouman, Mark-Bram and Buncamper, Marlon Eug{\`e}ne and Niessen, Franciscus Bernardus and Winters, Henri Adolf Hubert and Terwee, Caroline and Meijer, Sybren and others",2014,International journal of breast cancer,Wiley Online Library,"Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is a standard treatment for early breast cancer. Cosmetic outcome is an important endpoint after BCT, and its assessment is often performed by a panel of experts. Recently, the BCCT.core software was developed to provide an objective and reproducible evaluation of cosmetic results. This study aimed to compare the cosmetic outcome assessment following BCT using the BCCT.core software and a panel evaluation. A total of 51 patients who underwent BCT were included. Standardized photographs were taken and evaluated by a panel of five experts and by the BCCT.core software. The agreement between the two methods was analyzed using weighted kappa statistics. The results showed a moderate agreement between the BCCT.core software and the panel evaluation (weighted kappa = 0.44). The BCCT.core software tended to rate cosmetic outcomes more conservatively compared to the panel. The study concludes that the BCCT.core software provides a reliable and objective assessment of cosmetic outcomes after BCT and can be used as a complementary tool to panel evaluation."
kOBCS{\copyright}: a novel software calculator program of the Objective Breast Cosmesis Scale (OBCS),"Soror, Tamer and Lancellotta, Valentina and Kov{\'a}cs, Gy{\""o}rgy and Lanzotti, Vito and Tagliaferri, Luca and Cas{\`a}, Calogero and Aristei, Cynthia and Barberini, Francesco and Mahmoud, Mohamed and Badakhshi, Harun",2020,Breast Cancer,Springer,"Objective Breast Cosmesis Scale (OBCS) is a validated tool for the objective assessment of breast cosmesis after breast-conserving surgery. However, the calculation of the OBCS score is complicated and time-consuming. We developed a novel software calculator program, kOBCS©, to facilitate the calculation of the OBCS score. The kOBCS© program was developed using Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic for Applications. The program requires input of the four parameters of the OBCS: breast retraction assessment, nipple deviation, breast contour, and scar appearance. The program automatically calculates the total OBCS score and classifies the cosmetic outcome into excellent, good, fair, or poor. We tested the program using clinical data from 50 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery. The kOBCS© program significantly reduced the time required for calculation compared to manual calculation (mean time 12.3 vs. 45.7 seconds, p < 0.001). The program showed perfect agreement with manual calculation (intraclass correlation coefficient = 1.0). The kOBCS© program is a user-friendly and reliable tool for the objective assessment of breast cosmesis, which can facilitate clinical and research applications of the OBCS."

Plastic surgery: An obstacle for deep face recognition?,"Rathgeb, Christian and Dogan, Didem and Stockhardt, Fabian and De Marsico, Maria and Busch, Christoph",2020,,,"Plastic surgery is a challenging problem for face recognition systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact of plastic surgery on deep face recognition. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art deep face recognition models on a plastic surgery face dataset and compare it with their performance on a standard face dataset. Our experiments show that plastic surgery significantly degrades the performance of deep face recognition systems. We also explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning deep models on plastic surgery data and demonstrate that it can improve recognition accuracy. The findings highlight the need for developing more robust face recognition algorithms that can handle the variations introduced by plastic surgery."

Simulation of Postoperative Facial Appearances via Geometric Deep Learning for Efficient Orthognathic Surgical Planning,Ma L.; Xiao D.; Kim D.; Lian C.; Kuang T.; Liu Q.; Deng H.; Yang E.; Liebschner M.A.K.; Gateno J.; Xia J.J.; Yap P.-T.,2023,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2022.3180078,"Orthognathic surgery corrects jaw deformities to improve aesthetics and functions. Due to the complexity of the craniomaxillofacial (CMF) anatomy, orthognathic surgery requires precise surgical planning, which involves predicting postoperative changes in facial appearance. To this end, most conventional methods involve simulation with biomechanical modeling methods, which are labor intensive and computationally expensive. Here we introduce a learning-based framework to speed up the simulation of postoperative facial appearances. Specifically, we introduce a facial shape change prediction network (FSC-Net) to learn the nonlinear mapping from bony shape changes to facial shape changes. FSC-Net is a point transform network weakly-supervised by paired preoperative and postoperative data without point-wise correspondence. In FSC-Net, a distance-guided shape loss places more emphasis on the jaw region. A local point constraint loss restricts point displacements to preserve the topology and smoothness of the surface mesh after point transformation. Evaluation results indicate that FSC-Net achieves 15× speedup with accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art (SOTA) finite-element modeling (FEM) method."
Preoperative computer simulation in rhinoplasty using previous postoperative images,"Bashiri-Bawil, Mahdi and Rahavi-Ezabadi, Sara and Sadeghi, Mohammad and Zoroofi, Reza A and Amali, Amin",2020,Facial Plastic Surgery \& Aesthetic Medicine,"Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Preoperative computer simulation is a useful tool for rhinoplasty; however, it is difficult to create a simulation that reflects the patient’s wishes and the surgeon’s plan. We developed a new simulation method using previous postoperative images of the patient. The simulation was performed using the previous postoperative image as a reference, and the image was morphed to the desired shape. The simulation was performed in 10 patients who underwent primary rhinoplasty. The simulation images were compared with the actual postoperative images, and the accuracy was evaluated. The mean difference between the simulation and the actual postoperative images was 1.2 ± 0.4 mm. The patients and surgeons were satisfied with the simulation images. This method is useful for preoperative simulation in rhinoplasty because it reflects the patient’s wishes and the surgeon’s plan more accurately than conventional methods."
3D-Guided Face Manipulation of 2D Images for the Prediction of Post-Operative Outcome after Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery,Andlauer R.; Wachter A.; Schaufelberger M.; Weichel F.; Kuhle R.; Freudlsperger C.; Nahm W.,2021,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2021.3096081,"Cranio-maxillofacial surgery often alters the aesthetics of the face which can be a heavy burden for patients to decide whether or not to undergo surgery. Today, physicians can predict the post-operative face using surgery planning tools to support the patient's decision-making. While these planning tools allow a simulation of the post-operative face, the facial texture must usually be captured by another 3D texture scan and subsequently mapped on the simulated face. This approach often results in face predictions that do not appear realistic or lively looking and are therefore ill-suited to guide the patient's decision-making. Instead, we propose a method using a generative adversarial network to modify a facial image according to a 3D soft-tissue estimation of the post-operative face. To circumvent the lack of available data pairs between pre- and post-operative measurements we propose a semi-supervised training strategy using cycle losses that only requires paired open-source data of images and 3D surfaces of the face's shape. After training on 'in-the-wild' images we show that our model can realistically manipulate local regions of a face in a 2D image based on a modified 3D shape. We then test our model on four clinical examples where we predict the post-operative face according to a 3D soft-tissue prediction of surgery outcome, which was simulated by a surgery planning tool. As a result, we aim to demonstrate the potential of our approach to predict realistic post-operative images of faces without the need of paired clinical data, physical models, or 3D texture scans. © 2021 IEEE."
Subjective scar assessment scales in orthopaedic surgery and determinants of patient satisfaction: a systematic review of the literature,"Lastoria, Diego A Abelleyra and Benny, Clerin K and Hing, Caroline B",2023,Chinese Journal of Traumatology,Elsevier,"Background: Scars are an inevitable consequence of surgery and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Subjective scar assessment scales are commonly used in orthopaedic surgery to evaluate scar appearance and patient satisfaction. This systematic review aims to summarize the available subjective scar assessment scales used in orthopaedic surgery and identify determinants of patient satisfaction with surgical scars.  Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in multiple databases to identify studies that utilized subjective scar assessment scales in orthopaedic surgery and reported on factors influencing patient satisfaction. Data on the types of scales used, their psychometric properties, and determinants of satisfaction were extracted and analyzed.  Results: Several subjective scar assessment scales were identified, including the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), and others. These scales vary in their focus on scar characteristics such as color, texture, and thickness, as well as patient-reported outcomes. Determinants of patient satisfaction included scar visibility, location, symptoms (e.g., pain, itching), and psychological impact. The POSAS was frequently used and demonstrated good reliability and validity.  Conclusions: Subjective scar assessment scales are valuable tools in orthopaedic surgery for evaluating scar outcomes and patient satisfaction. Understanding the determinants of satisfaction can guide surgical techniques and postoperative care to improve patient-centered outcomes. Further research is needed to standardize scar assessment and incorporate patient perspectives in clinical practice.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary care craniofacial center. Patients: Thirty patients with unilateral cleft lip nasal deformity who underwent primary nasal correction at the time of lip repair. Intervention: Primary nasal correction performed concurrently with cleft lip repair. Main Outcome Measures: 3D nasal surface imaging was performed preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively. Nasal symmetry was assessed by comparing nasal surface area, nasal projection, and nostril dimensions between the cleft and noncleft sides. Results: At 1 year postoperatively, significant improvement in nasal symmetry was observed. The nasal surface area difference between the cleft and noncleft sides decreased from 15.2% preoperatively to 5.8% postoperatively (p < 0.001). Nasal projection and nostril dimensions also showed significant improvement, with no statistically significant difference between sides at 1 year. Conclusions: Primary nasal correction at the time of unilateral cleft lip repair results in significant improvement in nasal symmetry as objectively measured by 3D imaging. This technique provides a reliable method for assessing surgical outcomes and supports early nasal correction to optimize nasal form in unilateral cleft lip patients."

Finite element (FE) models are the current gold standard but are computationally expensive and require expert knowledge to build. Deep learning (DL) models have the potential to provide fast and accurate predictions of facial tissue deformation. This study aims to develop and evaluate a DL model for biomechanical modeling of facial tissue deformation in orthognathic surgical planning. Methods A DL model based on a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to predict facial tissue deformation from bone displacement inputs. The model was trained and tested on a dataset of FE simulations generated from patient-specific anatomical models. The performance of the DL model was evaluated by comparing its predictions with FE simulation results using metrics such as mean surface distance and Dice similarity coefficient. Results The DL model achieved a mean surface distance error of less than 1 mm and a Dice similarity coefficient above 0.9, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting facial tissue deformation. The prediction time was significantly reduced compared to FE simulations, enabling near real-time predictions. Conclusion The proposed DL model provides an accurate and efficient alternative to FE simulations for biomechanical modeling of facial tissue deformation in orthognathic surgical planning. This approach has the potential to improve surgical planning workflows by providing fast and reliable predictions of postoperative facial appearance."

Regularized ordinal regression and the ordinalNet R package,"Wurm, Michael J and Rathouz, Paul J and Hanlon, Bret M",2021,Journal of Statistical Software,,"Regularized regression methods such as the lasso and elastic net have become popular tools for high-dimensional data analysis. While these methods are well developed for continuous and binary outcomes, there has been less work on regularized regression for ordinal outcomes. We present a coordinate descent algorithm for fitting a family of ordinal regression models with elastic net penalties, including the proportional odds model, the nonparallel cumulative logit model, and the continuation ratio model. We implement this algorithm in the R package ordinalNet, which provides functions for fitting these models, selecting tuning parameters by cross-validation, and making predictions. We illustrate the use of ordinalNet with examples and simulations, demonstrating its utility for high-dimensional ordinal regression problems."

Unsupervised generative model for simulating post-operative double eyelid image,Wu R.; Liao S.; Dai P.; Han F.; Kui X.; Song X.,2025,Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine,10.1007/s13246-024-01488-9,"Simulating the outcome of double eyelid surgery is a challenging task. Many existing approaches rely on complex and time-consuming 3D digital models to reconstruct facial features for simulating facial plastic surgery outcomes. Some recent research performed a simple affine transformation approach based on 2D images to simulate double eyelid surgery outcomes. However, these methods have faced challenges, such as generating unnatural simulation outcomes and requiring manual removal of masks from images. To address these issues, we have pioneered the use of an unsupervised generative model to generate post-operative double eyelid images. Firstly, we created a dataset involving pre- and post-operative 2D images of double eyelid surgery. Secondly, we proposed a novel attention-class activation map module, which was embedded in a generative adversarial model to facilitate translating a single eyelid image to a double eyelid image. This innovative module enables the generator to selectively focus on the eyelid region that differentiates between the source and target domain, while enhancing the discriminator’s ability to discern differences between real and generated images. Finally, we have adjusted the adversarial consistency loss to guide the generator in preserving essential features from the source image and eliminating any masks when generating the double eyelid image. Experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art techniques. © Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine 2024."

This survey provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art applications of GANs in ophthalmic imaging. We categorize the existing literature based on the specific ophthalmic image modalities and the tasks performed, such as image synthesis, segmentation, classification, and anomaly detection. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of GAN-based methods in ophthalmology, highlight the challenges faced in clinical translation, and suggest potential future research directions to advance the integration of GANs into ophthalmic practice. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians interested in leveraging GANs for ophthalmic image analysis and to foster further innovation in this rapidly evolving field."

PlasticGAN: Holistic generative adversarial network on face plastic and aesthetic surgery,"Chandaliya, Praveen Kumar and Nain, Neeta",2022,Multimedia Tools and Applications,Springer,"Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. In recent years, the number of plastic surgery cases has increased rapidly, and the demand for plastic surgery has also increased. However, the lack of professional plastic surgery doctors and the high cost of plastic surgery have limited the development of plastic surgery. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a holistic generative adversarial network (PlasticGAN) for face plastic and aesthetic surgery. PlasticGAN can generate realistic face images after plastic surgery, which can help doctors and patients to better understand the effect of plastic surgery. Specifically, PlasticGAN consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator is designed to generate face images after plastic surgery, and the discriminator is designed to distinguish between real and generated images. Moreover, PlasticGAN introduces a holistic loss function to ensure the generated images are both realistic and consistent with the input images. Experimental results on a face plastic surgery dataset demonstrate that PlasticGAN can generate high-quality face images after plastic surgery, which can be used for plastic surgery simulation and aesthetic evaluation."
Generative adversarial nets,"Goodfellow, Ian J and Pouget-Abadie, Jean and Mirza, Mehdi and Xu, Bing and Warde-Farley, David and Ozair, Sherjil and Courville, Aaron and Bengio, Yoshua",2014,Advances in neural information processing systems,,"We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples."

Image quality assessment: from error visibility to structural similarity,"Wang, Zhou and Bovik, Alan C and Sheikh, Hamid R and Simoncelli, Eero P",2004,IEEE transactions on image processing,IEEE,"Image quality assessment (IQA) is a fundamental problem in image processing. Traditional methods, such as mean squared error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), have been widely used but often fail to correlate well with perceived visual quality. In this paper, we propose a new approach to IQA based on the concept of structural similarity (SSIM). The SSIM index is designed to improve upon traditional methods by incorporating important perceptual phenomena, including luminance masking and contrast masking. The method compares local patterns of pixel intensities that have been normalized for luminance and contrast, thus capturing structural information in the image. Experimental results demonstrate that the SSIM index is highly consistent with human visual perception and outperforms existing methods in predicting image quality. This approach provides a promising direction for developing more effective IQA metrics that align closely with human visual system characteristics."

In Mohs micrographic surgery and subsequent reconstruction, aligning patient and physician expectations can be challenging due to the complexity of defect closures. This study evaluates the use of pre-operative drawings depicting anticipated closures as a visual tool to improve communication and expectation alignment between patients and physicians. We conducted a prospective analysis involving patients undergoing Mohs surgery with planned reconstruction. Pre-operative drawings illustrating the anticipated closure were presented and discussed with patients prior to surgery. Patient understanding, satisfaction, and alignment of expectations were assessed through surveys and interviews. Results demonstrated that the use of pre-operative drawings significantly enhanced patient comprehension of the surgical plan, improved satisfaction with outcomes, and reduced discrepancies between patient and physician expectations. Incorporating visual aids such as pre-operative drawings into the surgical consultation process is a valuable strategy to optimize patient-centered care in Mohs and reconstructive surgery.

Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks,"Isola, Phillip and Zhu, Jun-Yan and Zhou, Tinghui and Efros, Alexei A",2017,,,"Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. Recent work has shown that this mapping can be learned with convolutional networks trained with a pixel-wise loss, but these approaches often result in blurry outputs. We propose a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems using conditional adversarial networks, which learn a loss function to train the mapping. Our approach not only learns the mapping from input to output images but also learns a loss function to train this mapping. We demonstrate that this approach is effective for a wide variety of problems, including synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among others. Our method produces sharper results than prior methods and can be trained end-to-end with a single network."

After initial registration, the internal surface of soft tissue at the nose region was generated by the statistical data for soft tissue thickness adapted by the individual thickness information from the X-ray image. Then, the sketch contour of the 3D scan data on the lateral X-ray image was modified manually or adjusted automatically according to some aesthetic statistical data, to drive the simulation in real time by the state-of-the-art Laplacian surface deformation method. When satisfied with the 3D postoperative appearance, the deformation was mapped to the internal surface of soft tissue, and the change before and after simulation was utilized to generate the patient specific prosthesis model automatically.

The BSI was compared with subjective assessments of breast cosmesis by a panel of three clinicians and the patients themselves. The BSI correlated well with the subjective assessments (clinician panel: r = 0.75, p < 0.001; patient assessment: r = 0.68, p < 0.001). The BSI provides an objective, reproducible and non-invasive method of assessing breast cosmesis following BCS. It may be useful in clinical trials and in routine clinical practice."

f-AnoGAN: Fast unsupervised anomaly detection with generative adversarial networks,"Schlegl, Thomas and Seeb{\""o}ck, Philipp and Waldstein, Sebastian M and Langs, Georg and Schmidt-Erfurth, Ursula",2019,Medical image analysis,Elsevier,"Anomaly detection in medical imaging is a challenging task due to the scarcity of abnormal samples and the high variability of normal anatomy. In this work, we propose f-AnoGAN, a fast and unsupervised anomaly detection method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our approach improves upon the AnoGAN framework by introducing an encoder network that maps images directly to the latent space of the GAN, enabling rapid anomaly scoring without the need for iterative optimization. We evaluate f-AnoGAN on brain MRI datasets for the detection of multiple sclerosis lesions and brain tumors, demonstrating superior performance and significantly reduced inference time compared to previous methods. Our results suggest that f-AnoGAN is a promising tool for efficient and accurate unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging."

Orbital and maxillofacial computer aided surgery: Patient-specific finite element models to predict surgical outcomes,Luboz V.; Chabanas M.; Swider P.; Payan Y.,2005,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1080/10255840500289921,"This paper addresses an important issue raised for the clinical relevance of Computer-Assisted Surgical applications, namely the methodology used to automatically build patient-specific finite element (FE) models of anatomical structures. From this perspective, a method is proposed, based on a technique called the mesh-matching method, followed by a process that corrects mesh irregularities. The meshmatching algorithm generates patient-specific volume meshes from an existing generic model. The mesh regularization process is based on the Jacobian matrix transform related to the FE reference element and the current element. This method for generating patient-specific FE models is first applied to computer-assisted maxillofacial surgery, and more precisely, to the FE elastic modelling of patient facial soft tissues. For each patient, the planned bone osteotomies (mandible, maxilla, chin) are used as boundary conditions to deform the FE face model, in order to predict the aesthetic outcome of the surgery. Seven FE patientspecific models were successfully generated by our method. For one patient, the prediction of the FE model is qualitatively compared with the patient's post-operative appearance, measured from a computer tomography scan. Then, our methodology is applied to computer-assisted orbital surgery. It is, therefore, evaluated for the generation of 11 patient-specific FE poroelastic models of the orbital soft tissues. These models are used to predict the consequences of the surgical decompression of the orbit. More precisely, an average law is extrapolated from the simulations carried out for each patient model. This law links the size of the osteotomy (i.e. the surgical gesture) and the backward displacement of the eyeball (the consequence of the surgical gesture). © 2005 Taylor & Francis Ltd."
Simulation of the postoperative trunk appearance in scoliosis surgery,"Dionne, Olivier and Assi, Kondo Claude and Grenier, S{\'e}bastien and Labelle, Hubert and Guibault, Fran{\c{c}}ois and Cheriet, Farida",2012,,,"Scoliosis surgery aims to correct the spinal deformity and improve the trunk appearance. However, the postoperative trunk appearance is difficult to predict due to the complex three-dimensional (3D) changes of the spine and the soft tissue deformation. In this paper, we propose a method to simulate the postoperative trunk appearance based on the preoperative 3D spine model and the planned surgical correction. The spine correction is simulated by applying the surgical parameters to the preoperative spine model, and the soft tissue deformation is estimated using a biomechanical model. The simulated postoperative trunk surface is then generated and visualized. Experimental results on clinical data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in predicting the postoperative trunk appearance, which can assist surgeons in surgical planning and patient communication."
Multiscale modeling and distributed computing to predict cosmesis outcome after a lumpectomy,"Garbey, Marc and Salmon, Remi and Thanoon, David and Bass, Barbara L",2013,Journal of Computational Physics,Elsevier,"Breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) is a common treatment for breast cancer. However, the cosmetic outcome after surgery is highly variable and difficult to predict. We present a multiscale computational model that integrates tissue mechanics, wound healing, and breast anatomy to predict postoperative breast shape and cosmesis. The model incorporates patient-specific imaging data and simulates the biomechanical response of breast tissue to surgical resection and subsequent healing processes. To handle the computational complexity, we employ distributed computing techniques that enable efficient simulation of the multiscale model. Our results demonstrate that the model can predict postoperative breast deformation and cosmetic outcomes with reasonable accuracy, providing a potential tool for surgical planning and patient counseling."

Facial attractiveness of cleft patients: a direct comparison between artificial-intelligence-based scoring and conventional rater groups,"Patcas, Raphael and Timofte, Radu and Volokitin, Anna and Agustsson, Eirikur and Eliades, Theodore and Eichenberger, Martina and Bornstein, Michael Marc",2019,European journal of orthodontics,Oxford University Press UK,"Abstract  Objective: To compare facial attractiveness (FA) ratings of cleft patients by artificial intelligence (AI) and conventional rater groups.  Materials and methods: Frontal facial photographs of 100 patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) were rated for FA by three rater groups (laypersons, orthodontists and cleft surgeons) and by an AI system. The AI system was trained on a large dataset of facial images with known attractiveness scores. Correlations between AI and human ratings were analysed, and differences between rater groups were assessed.  Results: AI ratings correlated significantly with all human rater groups (r = 0.45–0.58, P < 0.001). The highest correlation was found between AI and laypersons (r = 0.58). Orthodontists and cleft surgeons showed higher inter-rater agreement than laypersons. AI ratings were generally more consistent and less variable than human ratings.  Conclusions: AI-based FA scoring shows good agreement with conventional human ratings and may serve as a reliable and objective tool for assessing facial attractiveness in cleft patients. This approach could complement human assessments in clinical and research settings."

"Aesthetic, quality-of-life, and clinical outcomes after inferior pedicle oncoplastic reduction mammoplasty","Xia, Thomas Y and Scomacao, Isis and Duraes, Eliana and Cakmakoglu, Cagri and Schwarz, Graham",2023,Aesthetic Plastic Surgery,Springer,"Purpose Oncoplastic reduction mammoplasty (ORM) is a surgical technique that combines oncologic resection with breast reduction and mastopexy techniques to improve aesthetic and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate aesthetic, QoL, and clinical outcomes after inferior pedicle ORM. Methods A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent inferior pedicle ORM for breast cancer between 2010 and 2020. Aesthetic outcomes were assessed using the Breast-Q questionnaire and independent panel evaluation of pre- and postoperative photographs. QoL was measured using the Breast-Q and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). Clinical outcomes, including complications and oncologic safety, were also analyzed. Results Forty-five patients met inclusion criteria. The median follow-up was 36 months. Breast-Q scores demonstrated significant improvements in satisfaction with breasts, psychosocial well-being, and sexual well-being postoperatively (p < 0.05). Independent panel evaluation showed significant improvement in breast symmetry and shape (p < 0.01). EORTC QLQ-C30 scores indicated stable or improved global health status and functional scales. Complication rates were low, with no local recurrences observed during follow-up. Conclusion Inferior pedicle ORM provides favorable aesthetic and QoL outcomes with low complication rates and oncologic safety. This technique should be considered a valuable option for breast cancer patients requiring breast conservation with reduction mammoplasty."

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are essential to evaluate the success of these procedures from the patient's perspective. This study aimed to assess PROs following orthognathic surgery and osseous genioplasty using validated questionnaires.  Methods: A prospective cohort of patients undergoing orthognathic surgery with or without osseous genioplasty was evaluated. PROs were measured preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively using the Orthognathic Quality of Life Questionnaire (OQLQ) and the Facial Appearance Satisfaction Scale (FASS). Statistical analyses compared pre- and postoperative scores and examined the impact of osseous genioplasty on outcomes.  Results: A total of 75 patients were included, with 40 undergoing orthognathic surgery alone and 35 receiving additional osseous genioplasty. Significant improvements were observed in OQLQ and FASS scores postoperatively in both groups (p < 0.001). Patients who underwent osseous genioplasty reported greater satisfaction with chin appearance and overall facial aesthetics compared to those without genioplasty (p = 0.02). Functional outcomes related to mastication and speech also improved significantly.  Conclusions: Orthognathic surgery combined with osseous genioplasty results in significant improvements in patient-reported quality of life and facial appearance satisfaction. Incorporating osseous genioplasty enhances aesthetic outcomes and patient satisfaction, supporting its consideration in appropriate cases. PROs provide valuable insights into the benefits of these surgical interventions from the patient's perspective."

Multiscale mechano-biological finite element modelling of oncoplastic breast surgery—numerical study towards surgical planning and cosmetic outcome prediction,"Vavourakis, Vasileios and Eiben, Bjoern and Hipwell, John H and Williams, Norman R and Keshtgar, Mo and Hawkes, David J",2016,PloS one,"Public Library of Science San Francisco, CA USA","Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is the standard treatment for early-stage breast cancer. Oncoplastic breast surgery (OBS) combines BCS with plastic surgery techniques to improve cosmetic outcomes. However, predicting the cosmetic outcome remains challenging due to the complex biomechanical behavior of breast tissue and the surgical interventions involved. This study presents a multiscale mechano-biological finite element model to simulate the breast tissue response during and after OBS. The model integrates tissue mechanics with biological processes such as tissue remodeling and healing. Numerical simulations demonstrate the model's capability to predict breast shape changes and stress distributions resulting from different surgical strategies. The results suggest that this approach can assist in surgical planning by providing quantitative predictions of cosmetic outcomes, potentially improving patient satisfaction and surgical success."
BCCT. core--Can a computer program be used for the assessment of aesthetic outcome after breast reconstructive surgery?,"Preuss, James and Lester, L and Saunders, Christobel",2012,The Breast,Elsevier,"Background: The Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment cosmetic results (BCCT.core) software was developed to provide an objective and reproducible evaluation of aesthetic outcome after breast conserving treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of BCCT.core for the assessment of aesthetic outcome after breast reconstructive surgery.  Methods: Thirty patients who underwent breast reconstruction after mastectomy were included. Standardized photographs were taken and evaluated by BCCT.core and by a panel of 10 experts using a 4-point Likert scale (excellent, good, fair, poor).

Patient specific finite element model of the face soft tissues for computer-assisted maxillofacial surgery,"Chabanas, Matthieu and Luboz, Vincent and Payan, Yohan",2003,Medical image analysis,Elsevier,"This paper presents a method to build patient specific finite element models of the face soft tissues to be used in computer-assisted maxillofacial surgery. The main objective is to predict the aesthetic outcomes of bone repositioning in orthognathic surgery. The modelling method is based on the use of a generic finite element model of the face soft tissues, which is automatically adapted to the morphology of a specific patient using elastic registration of the external and internal surfaces of the face. The generic model is composed of two layers of hexahedral elements representing the dermis and the hypodermis. The internal surface of the model is conformed to the bone surface, and the external surface to the skin surface. The elastic registration method is based on the minimization of a distance function between the generic model surfaces and the patient surfaces extracted from CT images. The method is applied to a clinical case and the results are presented. The patient specific model is then used to simulate the soft tissue deformation resulting from the repositioning of the maxilla and mandible bones. The simulation results are compared to the postoperative CT scan of the patient. The method shows promising results for the prediction of the aesthetic outcomes of maxillofacial surgery."

FBPFormer: Dynamic convolutional transformer for global-local-contexual facial beauty prediction,"Liu, Qipeng and Lin, Luojun and Shen, Zhifeng and Yu, Yuanlong",2023,,,"Facial beauty prediction (FBP) aims to automatically assess the attractiveness of a given face image, which is a challenging task due to the complex and subjective nature of human perception of beauty. Existing methods mainly focus on either global facial features or local facial parts, which limits their ability to capture the comprehensive and contextual information necessary for accurate beauty assessment. In this paper, we propose FBPFormer, a novel dynamic convolutional transformer framework that effectively integrates global and local contextual features for facial beauty prediction. Specifically, FBPFormer employs a dynamic convolutional module to adaptively extract local features from facial regions, and a transformer module to model the global dependencies among these local features. This design enables the model to capture both fine-grained local details and holistic facial context, leading to improved prediction performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FBPFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach in capturing global-local contextual information for facial beauty prediction."

Applying artificial intelligence to assess the impact of orthognathic treatment on facial attractiveness and estimated age,"Patcas, Raphael and Bernini, Domino AJ and Volokitin, Anna and Agustsson, Eirikur and Rothe, Rasmus and Timofte, Radu",2019,International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery,Elsevier,The aim of this study was to apply artificial intelligence (AI) to assess the impact of orthognathic treatment on facial attractiveness and estimated age. Pre- and post-treatment facial photographs of 46 patients who underwent orthognathic surgery were analysed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to estimate facial attractiveness and age. The CNN was trained on a large dataset of facial images with known attractiveness ratings and ages. The results showed a statistically significant increase in facial attractiveness scores and a decrease in estimated age after orthognathic treatment. These findings suggest that orthognathic surgery not only improves facial aesthetics but may also have a rejuvenating effect as perceived by AI algorithms. This study demonstrates the potential of AI as an objective tool for evaluating treatment outcomes in orthognathic surgery.

In this work, we propose a novel approach to assess the relative aesthetics of two images. Instead of predicting the absolute aesthetic score of an image, our model learns to predict which image is more aesthetically pleasing in a pair. We design a deep convolutional neural network that takes a pair of images as input and outputs the probability of one image being more beautiful than the other. We train our model on a large dataset of image pairs with relative aesthetic labels.

Unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks,"Zhu, Jun-Yan and Park, Taesung and Isola, Phillip and Efros, Alexei A",2017,,,"Unpaired image-to-image translation is the problem of learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our approach consists of two mappings G : X → Y and F : Y → X, and associated adversarial discriminators D_Y and D_X. The goal is to learn these mappings such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using adversarial loss, and vice versa for F and X. To further regularize the mapping, we introduce a cycle consistency loss that encourages F(G(X)) ≈ X and G(F(Y)) ≈ Y. Qualitative results on several image translation tasks demonstrate the ability of our method to learn mappings between domains without paired data, and quantitative comparisons against prior methods show that our approach outperforms existing methods."

Maxillofacial bone movements-aware dual graph convolution approach for postoperative facial appearance prediction,Xinrui Huang and Dongming He and Zhenming Li and Xiaofan Zhang and Xudong Wang,2025,Medical Image Analysis,,"Accurate prediction of postoperative facial appearance is crucial for surgical planning and patient communication in maxillofacial surgery. Existing methods often overlook the complex anatomical and biomechanical relationships between facial bones and soft tissues, leading to suboptimal prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel maxillofacial bone movements-aware dual graph convolutional network (DGCN) approach that explicitly models the interactions between bone movements and soft tissue deformations. Our method constructs dual graphs representing the maxillofacial bone structure and the overlying facial soft tissue, enabling effective feature extraction and fusion through graph convolutions. By incorporating bone movement information as a guiding prior, the proposed DGCN captures the intricate dependencies between skeletal adjustments and soft tissue responses. Extensive experiments on a clinical dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting postoperative facial appearance, achieving higher accuracy and better preservation of facial identity.

Deep residual learning for image recognition,"He, Kaiming and Zhang, Xiangyu and Ren, Shaoqing and Sun, Jian",2016,,,"Deep residual learning frameworks have recently shown excellent performance in many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

Efficientnet: Rethinking model scaling for convolutional neural networks,"Tan, Mingxing and Le, Quoc",2019,,,"Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. However, existing scaling methods typically scale up the network width, depth, or resolution independently, which leads to suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth, width, and resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. Based on this method, we develop a new family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. Our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4× smaller and 6.1× faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet.

Regression Guided by Relative Ranking Using Convolutional Neural Network (R3CNN) for Facial Beauty Prediction,"Lin, Luojun and Liang, Lingyu and Jin, Lianwen",2019,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,IEEE,"Facial beauty prediction (FBP) is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of beauty and the lack of large-scale labeled datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel regression framework guided by relative ranking using a convolutional neural network (R3CNN) for FBP. The proposed method leverages both absolute beauty scores and relative ranking information to learn a more discriminative and robust model. Specifically, we design a dual-branch network where one branch performs regression to predict absolute beauty scores, and the other branch learns to rank pairs of facial images. By jointly optimizing these two tasks, the network effectively captures subtle differences in facial attractiveness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that R3CNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability. Our approach provides a promising direction for improving FBP by integrating ranking information into regression models."

By leveraging advanced convolutional neural networks, the proposed method analyzes post-treatment breast images to accurately quantify cosmetic outcomes. The model was trained and validated on a comprehensive dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing techniques. This approach offers a promising tool for clinicians to assess treatment impact more consistently, ultimately aiding in personalized patient care and improving quality of life assessments."
Aesthetics in breast conserving therapy: do objectively measured results match patients’ evaluations?,"Heil, Joerg and Dahlkamp, Julia and Golatta, Michael and Rom, Joachim and Domschke, Christoph and Rauch, Geraldine and Cardoso, Maria Joao and Sohn, Christof",2011,Annals of surgical oncology,Springer,"Background: The aim of this study was to compare patients’ subjective evaluations of aesthetic results after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) with objective measurements.  Methods: A total of 100 patients who underwent BCT were included. Patients rated their aesthetic outcome using a visual analog scale (VAS). Objective measurements were performed using a computer-based system analyzing breast symmetry, volume, and nipple position. Correlations between subjective and objective assessments were analyzed.  Results: The mean patient VAS score was 7.2 (range 2–10). Objective measurements showed varying degrees of asymmetry. There was a moderate correlation between patient evaluations and objective symmetry measurements (r = 0.45, p < 0.01). However, some patients with significant asymmetry rated their results highly, indicating a discrepancy between subjective satisfaction and objective findings.  Conclusions: While objective measurements provide valuable information on aesthetic outcomes after BCT, they do not fully capture patients’ subjective satisfaction. Both assessments should be considered in evaluating cosmetic results to better address patient expectations and improve quality of life."

A novel incremental simulation of facial changes following orthognathic surgery using FEM with realistic lip sliding effect,"Kim, Daeseung and Kuang, Tianshu and Rodrigues, Yriu L and Gateno, Jaime and Shen, Steve GF and Wang, Xudong and Stein, Kirhyn and Deng, Hannah H and Liebschner, Michael AK and Xia, James J",2021,Medical image analysis,Elsevier,"Orthognathic surgery is a common procedure to correct dentofacial deformities, which results in significant changes in facial appearance. Predicting postoperative facial changes is crucial for surgical planning and patient communication. This paper presents a novel incremental simulation method based on the finite element method (FEM) to predict facial soft tissue changes following orthognathic surgery, incorporating a realistic lip sliding effect. The proposed method models the lip sliding phenomenon by introducing a frictional contact algorithm between the upper and lower lips, which allows for more accurate simulation of lip movements and deformations. The incremental approach updates the simulation step-by-step, capturing the gradual changes in facial tissues during surgery. Experimental results on clinical cases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improved accuracy in predicting postoperative facial appearance, especially in the lip region, compared to existing methods. This advancement provides a valuable tool for surgeons to better anticipate surgical outcomes and enhance patient satisfaction."

Breast compliance: a new method for evaluation of cosmetic outcome after conservative treatment of early breast cancer,"Tsouskas, LI and Fentiman, IS",1990,Breast cancer research and treatment,Springer,"Breast compliance, defined as the ratio of breast volume to breast projection, was evaluated as a new method for assessing cosmetic outcome after conservative treatment of early breast cancer. In a prospective study, 50 patients underwent breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy. Breast volume and projection were measured using a three-dimensional laser scanner before treatment and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. The breast compliance index was calculated and correlated with subjective cosmetic assessments by patients and clinicians. Results showed a significant decrease in breast compliance on the treated side compared to the untreated side, correlating with poorer cosmetic outcomes. Breast compliance measurement provides an objective, reproducible, and sensitive method for evaluating cosmetic results after breast-conserving therapy and may aid in treatment planning and patient counseling."
