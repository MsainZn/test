Despite the complex osteointegration process being difficult to recreate in vitro, this study proposes an advanced in vitro tissue culture model of osteointegration using human bone. Cubic samples of trabecular bone were harvested, as waste material, from hip arthroplasty; inner cylindrical defects were created and assigned to the following groups: (1) empty defects (CTRneg); (2) defects implanted with a cytotoxic copper pin (CTRpos); (3) defects implanted with standard titanium pins (Ti). Tissues were dynamically cultured in mini rotating bioreactors and assessed weekly for viability and sterility. After 8 weeks, immunoenzymatic, microtomographic, histological, and histomorphometric analyses were performed. The model was able to simulate the effects of implantation of the materials, showing a drop in viability in CTR+, while Ti appears to have a trophic effect on bone. MicroCT and a histological analysis supported the results, with signs of matrix and bone deposition at the Ti implant site.

A novel three dimensional-printed biomechanically evaluated patient-specific sacral implant in spinopelvic reconstruction after total en bloc sacrectomy,Lv Z.; Li J.; Yang Z.; Li X.; Yang Q.; Li Z.,2023,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2023.1153801,"Background: Reconstruction after a total sacrectomy is a challenge due to the special anatomical and biomechanical factors. Conventional techniques of spinal-pelvic reconstruction do not reconstruct satisfactorily. We describe a novel three-dimensional-printed patient-specific sacral implant in spinopelvic reconstruction after total en bloc sacrectomy. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study including 12 patients with primary malignant sacral tumors, including 5 men and 7 women with a mean age of 58.25 years (range 20–66 years), undergoing total en bloc sacrectomy with 3D printed implant reconstruction from 2016 to 2021. There were 7 cases of chordoma, 3 cases of osteosarcoma, 1 case of chondrosarcoma and 1 case of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. We use CAD technology to determine surgical resection boundaries, design cutting guides, and individualized prostheses, and perform surgical simulations before surgery. The implant design was biomechanically evaluated by finite element analysis. Operative data, oncological and functional outcomes, complications, and implant osseointegration status of 12 consecutive patients were reviewed. Results: The implants were implanted successfully in 12 cases without death or severe complications during the perioperative period. Resection margins were wide in 11 patients and marginal in one patient. The average blood loss was 3875 mL (range, 2000–5,000 mL). The average surgical time was 520 min (range, 380–735 min). The mean follow-up was 38.5 months. Nine patients were alive with no evidence of disease, two patients died due to pulmonary metastases, and one patient survived with disease due to local recurrence. Overall survival was 83.33% at 24 months. The Mean VAS was 1.5 (range, 0–2). The mean MSTS score was 21 (range, 17–24). Wound complications occurred in 2 cases. A deep infection occurred in one patient and the implant was removed. No implant mechanical failure was identified. Satisfactory osseointegration was found in all patients, with a mean fusion time of 5 months (range 3–6 months).

Simple incision and suture modeling on fixed structured grids,Holm M.T.; Haugaard A.M.; Poulios K.; Aage N.,2024,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2024.106692,"Simple incision and suture modeling on fixed structured grids  This paper presents a simple yet versatile approach to simulate skin incisions and suturing using nonlinear finite element analysis on a fixed structured grid with a spring-based suture model. Incisions and wounds are introduced by element removal and the sutures are discretely modeled by applying linear constraint relations pairwise to groups of nodes. Two numerical examples utilize the closing of an elliptical wound to study the influence of the number of sutures and their location, and two test cases use the Z-plasty transposition flap technique to investigate the versatility of the proposed method and for comparison with state-of-the-art results. The results indicate that the presented method is able to recreate literature results to an acceptable level of accuracy. Further, the method proves versatile due to the ability to freely introduce incisions and wounds onto the fixed grid modeling domain without remeshing. Lastly, the two main advantages of the discrete suture representation are the ability to capture local stress concentrations near the sutures and the full freedom in placing the sutures. © 2024 The Author(s)",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical modeling without covering automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results, so it doesn’t fit the review’s topic on assessing aesthetic outcomes in plastic and cancer surgeries."

3D-Guided Face Manipulation of 2D Images for the Prediction of Post-Operative Outcome after Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery,Andlauer R.; Wachter A.; Schaufelberger M.; Weichel F.; Kuhle R.; Freudlsperger C.; Nahm W.,2021,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2021.3096081,"Cranio-maxillofacial surgery often alters the aesthetics of the face which can be a heavy burden for patients to decide whether or not to undergo surgery. Today, physicians can predict the post-operative face using surgery planning tools to support the patient's decision-making. While these planning tools allow a simulation of the post-operative face, the facial texture must usually be captured by another 3D texture scan and subsequently mapped on the simulated face. This approach often results in face predictions that do not appear realistic or lively looking and are therefore ill-suited to guide the patient's decision-making. Instead, we propose a method using a generative adversarial network to modify a facial image according to a 3D soft-tissue estimation of the post-operative face. To circumvent the lack of available data pairs between pre- and post-operative measurements we propose a semi-supervised training strategy using cycle losses that only requires paired open-source data of images and 3D surfaces of the face's shape. After training on 'in-the-wild' images we show that our model can realistically manipulate local regions of a face in a 2D image based on a modified 3D shape. We then test our model on four clinical examples where we predict the post-operative face according to a 3D soft-tissue prediction of surgery outcome, which was simulated by a surgery planning tool. As a result, we aim to demonstrate the potential of our approach to predict realistic post-operative images of faces without the need of paired clinical data, physical models, or 3D texture scans. © 2021 IEEE.",FALSE,

The synthetic implants are used for the reconstructive surgery of POP, but severe complications associated with their use have been reported, mainly related to their mechanical properties (e.g., implant stiffness) and microstructure. In this study, we mimicked a transvaginal reconstructive surgery to repair the apical ligaments (uterosacral ligaments (USLs) and cardinal ligaments (CLs)), by modeling, their impairment (90% and 50%) and/or total rupture. The implants to reinforce/replace these ligaments were built based on literature specifications and their mechanical properties were obtained through uniaxial tensile tests. The main aim of this study was to simulate the effect of mesh anchoring technique (simple stich and continuous stitch), and compare the displacement magnitude of the pelvic tissues, during Valsalva maneuver. The absence/presence of the synthetic implant was simulated when total rupture of the CLs and USLs occurs, causing a variation of the vaginal displacement (9% for the CLs and 27% for the USLs). Additionally, the simulations showed that there was a variation of the supero-inferior displacement of the vaginal wall between different anchoring techniques (simple stich and continuous stitch) being approximately of 10% for the simulation USLs and CLs implant.

Due to the limitation of fabricating screw hole threads in the PSMRP, 3D printed PSMRP is applied to the non-locking system directly in the mandibular reconstruction with bone graft regardless of the locking system. Since the conventional manual-bending reconstruction plate (CMBRP) provides better fixation in the locking system, it needs to be validated whether the locking PSMRP performs better than the non-locking PSMRP in the patient-specific mandibular reconstruction. Thereupon, the purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical behavior between the locking and non-locking PSMRP. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to conduct the biomechanical comparison between the locking PSMRP and non-locking PSMRP by simulating the momentary incisal clenching through static structural analysis. Mandible was reconstructed through the virtual surgical planning, and subsequently a 3D model of mandibular reconstruction assembly, including reconstructed mandible, PSMRP, and fixation screws, was generated and meshed for the following FEA simulations. In the form of equivalent von Mises stress, equivalent elastic strain, and total deformation, the locking PSMRP demonstrated its higher strengths of preferable safety, desirable flexibility, and anticipated stability compared with the non-locking PSMRP, indicated by much lower maximum stress, lower maximum strain and equivalent displacement. Locking PSMRP/screw system provides a better fixation effect to the patient-specific mandibular reconstruction than the non-locking one as a result of its productive fixation nature.

Due to the complexity of the craniomaxillofacial (CMF) anatomy, orthognathic surgery requires precise surgical planning, which involves predicting postoperative changes in facial appearance. To this end, most conventional methods involve simulation with biomechanical modeling methods, which are labor intensive and computationally expensive. Here we introduce a learning-based framework to speed up the simulation of postoperative facial appearances. Specifically, we introduce a facial shape change prediction network (FSC-Net) to learn the nonlinear mapping from bony shape changes to facial shape changes. FSC-Net is a point transform network weakly-supervised by paired preoperative and postoperative data without point-wise correspondence. In FSC-Net, a distance-guided shape loss places more emphasis on the jaw region. A local point constraint loss restricts point displacements to preserve the topology and smoothness of the surface mesh after point transformation. Evaluation results indicate that FSC-Net achieves 15× speedup with accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art (SOTA) finite-element modeling (FEM) method.",FALSE,

Subjective scar assessment scales in orthopaedic surgery and determinants of patient satisfaction: a systematic review of the literature,"Lastoria, Diego A Abelleyra and Benny, Clerin K and Hing, Caroline B",2023,Chinese Journal of Traumatology,Elsevier,"Background: Scars are an inevitable consequence of surgery and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Subjective scar assessment scales are commonly used in orthopaedic surgery to evaluate scar appearance and patient satisfaction. This systematic review aims to summarize the available subjective scar assessment scales used in orthopaedic surgery and identify determinants of patient satisfaction with surgical scars.  Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in multiple databases to identify studies that utilized subjective scar assessment scales in orthopaedic surgery and reported on factors influencing patient satisfaction. Data on the types of scales used, their psychometric properties, and determinants of satisfaction were extracted and analyzed.  Results: Several subjective scar assessment scales were identified, including the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), and others. These scales vary in their focus on scar characteristics such as color, texture, and thickness, as well as patient-reported outcomes. Determinants of patient satisfaction included scar visibility, location, symptoms (e.g., pain, itching), and psychological impact.

Plastic hexahedral FEM for surgical simulation,Gao R.; Peters J.,2022,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-022-02742-9,"Purpose: Soft-tissue manipulations, such as collecting, stretching or tearing tissue, are a common component of surgery. When too much force is applied, these manipulations result in a residual plastic deformation that surgeons should be aware of and that should be modeled by surgical simulation. Methods: Many tissues, vessels and organs can be modeled as offsets of curved simple shapes with primary directions, e.g., radial and axial for cylinders yield a rectangular mesh whose normal offset naturally yields a hexahedral mesh that can serve as a thick shell. Other organs are easy to embed into and deform following a hex mesh. We extend existing code for the volumetric finite element method (FEM) to model tissue plasticity as hexahedral thick shells or embedded organs. Specifically, the work extends the open source Simulation Open Framework Architecture and its newest hyperelastic deformation addition, Caribou, with focus on surgical simulation. The extension factors deformation gradients into (corotational or hyperelastic) elastic factors and plastic factors and enforces volume preservation. Limits on per-element twist, twist torque, material hardening and bounds on plasticity where elements invert avoid the need for re-meshing. Results: Our hexahedral FEM avoids the biased outcomes of asymmetric coarsely-partitioned tetrahedral FEM. Caribou’s hyperelastic FEM is extended to hex-FEM stretching plasticity. Our high-order accurate blended-vertex deformation enables coarse hex meshes to model large plastic rotational and stretch deformations without re-meshing. We compare a vertex-blended to a cell-centered piecewise constant approach; contrast plasticity based on corotational FEM and hyperelastic FEM; and test the computation under mesh refinement. The volume is preserved also for large deformations.

The first approach demonstrated high cell viability, as cells migrated out of the spheroid and colonised the interstitial space of the scaffold. These cells adopted an elongated morphology suggesting the internal architecture of the scaffold exerted topographical guidance. The second method demonstrated the high resilience of the scaffold to cyclic deformation and the secretion of a fibroblastic related protein was enhanced by the mechanical stimulation.

Owing to the experimental limitation and the risk of infection in handling the bone specimens, conducting experiments with all possible combinations of parameter values and selecting the suitable combination is largely limited. So in this paper, finite element analysis coupled with the constitutive models was used to early predict the thrust forces generated in the surgical bone drilling process. The constitutive models developed in the earlier study, namely, Johnson–Cook, Cowper–Symonds, and Johnson–Cook combined with Cowper–Symonds that consider the strain rate dependence of plastic curve were used for the simulations. Results revealed that the trends of the thrust force values predicted from the constitutive models matched well with the experiments.

Unsupervised generative model for simulating post-operative double eyelid image,Wu R.; Liao S.; Dai P.; Han F.; Kui X.; Song X.,2025,Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine,10.1007/s13246-024-01488-9,"Simulating the outcome of double eyelid surgery is a challenging task. Many existing approaches rely on complex and time-consuming 3D digital models to reconstruct facial features for simulating facial plastic surgery outcomes. Some recent research performed a simple affine transformation approach based on 2D images to simulate double eyelid surgery outcomes. However, these methods have faced challenges, such as generating unnatural simulation outcomes and requiring manual removal of masks from images. To address these issues, we have pioneered the use of an unsupervised generative model to generate post-operative double eyelid images. Firstly, we created a dataset involving pre- and post-operative 2D images of double eyelid surgery. Secondly, we proposed a novel attention-class activation map module, which was embedded in a generative adversarial model to facilitate translating a single eyelid image to a double eyelid image.

Study and numerical analysis of Von Mises stress of a new tumor-type distal femoral prosthesis comprising a peek composite reinforced with carbon fibers: finite element analysis,Guo Y.; Guo W.,2022,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1080/10255842.2022.2032681,"Research on carbon-fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CF-PEEK/CFR-PEEK) as a bone tumor joint prosthesis remains limited. Herein we numerically determine the feasibility of CF-PEEK material containing 30% Wt carbon fiber (CF30-PEEK) as a material for the dual-action tumor-type distal femoral prosthesis. Use CT scan method to build a complete finite element model of the knee joint. Simulate the resection of the distal femoral tumor, and then reconstruct it with the dual-action tumor-type distal femoral prosthesis. The femoral condyle and extension rod components were simulated with cobalt chromium molybdenum (CoCrMo), PEEK and CF30-PEEK materials respectively. When simulating the standing state, a vertical stress of 700 N is applied to the femoral head. When simulating the squatting state, a vertical stress of 2800 N is applied to the femoral head. The displacement and rotation angle of each node of the distal tibia are fully restrained in three directions (X-axis, Y-axis, Z-axis). We examined the stress magnitude, stress distribution, and stability of the prosthesis and each of its components by means of finite element analysis (FE analysis). The FE analysis results show: after replacing the distal femur and the extension rod with CF30-PEEK material, the stress is still evenly distributed, and the average stress is significantly reduced.

Mass-spring networks, while fast, do not provide the required accuracy. Methods: This paper presents an interactive, cognitive, facial flaps simulator based on a projective dynamics computational framework. Projective dynamics is able to generate rapid, stable results following changes to the facial soft tissues created by the surgeon, even in the face of sudden increases in skin resistance as its stretch limit is reached or collision between tissues occurs. Our prior work with the finite element method had been hampered by these considerations. Surgical tools are provided for; skin incision, undermining, deep tissue cutting, and excision. A spring-like “skin hook” is used for retraction. Spring-based sutures can be placed individually or automatically placed as a row between cardinal sutures. Results: Examples of an Abbe/Estlander lip reconstruction, a paramedian forehead flap to the nose, a retroauricular flap reconstruction of the external ear, and a cervico-facial flap reconstruction of a cheek defect are presented.

Current reconstruction algorithms mainly generate reference models from the image analysis aspect, however, clinical indicators of the CMF reference model mostly consider the distribution of anatomical landmarks. Generating a reference model with optimal clinical evaluation helps promote the feasibility of an algorithm. Methods: We first build a dataset with 100 normal skull models and then calculate a statistical shape model (SSM) and the distribution of normal cephalometric values, which indicate the statistical features of a population. To further generate personalized reference models, we apply non-rigid registration to align the SSM with the defect skull model. An evaluation standard to select the optimal reference model considers both global performance and anatomical evaluation. Moreover, we develop a landmark detection network to improve the automatic level of the algorithm. Results: The proposed method performs better than methods including Iterative Closest Point and SSM. From a global evaluation aspect, the results show that the RMSE between the reference model and the ground truth is 1.71 ± 0.23 mm, the percentage of vertices with error below 2 mm is 85 ± 4 % and the average faces distance is 1.38 ± 0.20 mm (better than the state-of-the-art method). From the anatomical evaluation aspect, the target registration error between the landmark pairs is 4.12 ± 2.27 mm. In addition, the clinical application confirms that the reference model can meet clinical requirements.

We propose a system to simulate and guide the shaping effect analysis, which could produce a similar but more harmonious face simulation. To this end, first, the depth camera based on structured light coding is employed for facial 3D data acquisition, from which the point cloud data of multiple facial perspectives could be obtained. Next, the cascade regression tree algorithm is used to extract the esthetic key points of the face model and to calculate the facial features composed of the key points, such as the nose, chin, and eyes. Quantitative facial esthetic indexes are offered to doctors to simulate PS. Afterward, we exploit a face mesh metamorphosis based on finite elements. We design several morphing operators, including augmentation, cutting, and lacerating. Finally, the regional deformation is detected, and the operation effect is quantitatively evaluated by registering the 3D scanning model before and after the operation. The test of our proposed system and the simulation of PS operations find that the measurement error of facial geometric features is 0.458 mm, and the area is 0.65 mm2. The ratings of the simulation outcomes provided by panels of PS prove that the system is effective. The manipulated 3D faces are deemed more beautiful compared to the original faces respecting the beauty canons such as facial symmetry and the golden ratio.

The Association Between Geometry and Wall Stress in Emergently Repaired Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,Chauhan S.S.; Gutierrez C.A.; Thirugnanasambandam M.; De Oliveira V.; Muluk S.C.; Eskandari M.K.; Finol E.A.,2017,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,10.1007/s10439-017-1837-1,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a prevalent cardiovascular disease characterized by the focal dilation of the aorta, which supplies blood to all the organs and tissues in the systemic circulation. With the AAA increasing in diameter over time, the risk of aneurysm rupture is generally associated with the size of the aneurysm. If diagnosed on time, intervention is recommended to prevent AAA rupture. The criterion to decide on surgical intervention is determined by measuring the maximum diameter of the aneurysm relative to the critical value of 5.5 cm. However, a more reliable approach could be based on understanding the biomechanical behavior of the aneurysmal wall. In addition, geometric features that are proven to be significant predictors of the AAA wall mechanics could be used as surrogates of the AAA biomechanical behavior and, subsequently, of the aneurysm’s risk of rupture. The aim of this work is to identify those geometric indices that have a high correlation with AAA wall stress in the population of patients who received an emergent repair of their aneurysm. In-house segmentation and meshing algorithms were used to model 75 AAAs followed by estimation of the spatially distributed wall stress by performing finite element analysis. Fifty-two shape and size geometric indices were calculated for the same models using MATLAB scripting. Hypotheses testing were carried out to identify the indices significantly correlated with wall stress by constructing a Pearson’s correlation coefficient matrix. The analyses revealed that 12 indices displayed high correlation with the wall stress, amongst which wall thickness and curvature-based indices exhibited the highest correlations. Stepwise regression analysis of these correlated indices indicated that wall stress can be predicted by the following four indices with an accuracy of 76%: maximum aneurysm diameter, aneurysm sac length, average wall thickness at the maximum diameter cross-section, and the median of the wall thickness variance. The primary outcome of this work emphasizes the use of global measures of size and wall thickness as geometric surrogates of wall stress for emergently repaired AAAs. © 2017, Biomedical Engineering Society.",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical analysis of abdominal aortic aneurysms without covering automatic prediction or aesthetic outcome evaluation in plastic or cancer surgery, so it doesn’t fit the review’s scope."

In this paper, the aim was to report our experience with 3DR modeling to determine resection and plan the surgical reconstruction in a patient with a desmoid tumor of the chest wall. For a better understanding of the case study, we describe all the steps from acquiring computed tomography (CT) scans to the final 3D rendering. A 68-year-old, non-smoking man presented at our outpatient department with painless swelling of the right anterobasal chest wall. A thorax–abdomen–brain CT scan revealed homogenous solid tissue with a dense mass measuring 80 mm × 62 mm. The final 3D model was evaluated by the surgical team (three medical doctors), who found the model to be powerful. Based on the results and the accuracy of the model, the multidisciplinary team decided that the tumor was resectable. Consequently, a surgical plan based on the 3D model was developed to perform chest wall reconstruction after radical resection. The patient underwent right anterolateral thoracotomy at the seventh intercostal space, which confirmed the CT scan findings and revealed infiltration of the serratus muscle and medial portion of the diaphragm.

The equivalent strain induced in the bone at the screw-bone interface reached maximum values of 2739 micro-strain for patient 1 and 19,575 micro-strain for patient 2. The results demonstrate the influence of design on the stresses induced in the plate and screw bodies. Of particular note, however, are the differences in the induced strains. Unphysiologically high strains in bone adjacent to screws can cause micro-damage leading to bone resorption. This can adversely affect the anchoring capabilities of the screws. Thus, while custom plates offer optimal anatomical fit, attention should be paid to the expected physiological forces on the plates and the induced stresses and strains in the plate-screw-bone assembly. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",TRUE,"Focuses on biomechanical details of reconstruction plates but doesn't cover automatic prediction or evaluation of aesthetic results, so it doesn't fit the review’s focus on assessing surgical aesthetics."

To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first integrated framework to process subject-specific 3D+t TEE AV data, determine age-matched material properties for the aortic and leaflet tissues, build a finite element model of the unpressurized AV, and simulate the AV function throughout a cardiac cycle. For geometric reconstruction purposes, dedicated software was created to acquire the 3-D coordinates of 21 anatomical landmarks of the AV apparatus in a systematic fashion. Measurements from ten 3D+t TEE datasets of normal AVs were assessed for inter- and intra-observer variability. These tests demonstrated mean measurement errors well within the acceptable range. Simulation of a complete cardiac cycle was successful for all ten valves and validated the novel schemes introduced to evaluate age-matched material properties and iteratively scale the unpressurized dimensions of the valves such that, given the determined material properties, the dimensions measured in vivo closely matched those simulated in late diastole. The leaflet coaptation area, describing the quality of the sealing of the valve, was measured directly from the medical images and was also obtained from the simulations; both approaches correlated well.

Modelling and structural analysis of skull/cranial implant: Beyond mid-line deformities,Bogu V.P.; Ravi Kumar Y.; Khanara A.K.,2017,Acta of Bioengineering and Biomechanics,10.5277/ABB-00547-2016-04,"Purpose: This computational study explores modelling and finite element study of the implant under Intracranial pressure (ICP) conditions with normal ICP range (7 mm Hg to 15 mm Hg) or increased ICP (>I5 mm Hg). The implant fixation points allow implant behaviour with respect to intracranial pressure conditions. However, increased fixation points lead to variation in deformation and equivalent stress. Finite element analysis is providing a valuable insight to know the deformation and equivalent stress. Methods: The patient CT data (Computed Tomography) is processed in Mimics software to get the mesh model. The implant is modelled by using modified reverse engineering technique with the help of Rhinoceros software. This modelling method is applicable for all types of defects including those beyond the middle line and multiple ones. It is designed with eight fixation points and ten fixation points to fix an implant. Consequently, the mechanical deformation and equivalent stress (von Mises) are calculated in ANSYS 15 software with distinctive material properties such as Titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK). Results: The deformation and equivalent stress results are obtained through ANSYS 15 software. It is observed that Ti6Al4V material shows low deformation and PEEK material shows less equivalent stress. Among all materials PEEK shows noticeably good result. Conclusions: Hence, a concept was established and more clinically relevant results can be expected with implementation of realistic 3D printed model in the future.

Recent development of a computer-assisted planning and execution (CAPE) system for Le Fort-based FJTT in a pre-clinical swine model offers preoperative planning, and intraoperative navigation. This paper addresses the translation of the CAPE system to human anatomy and presents accuracy results. Methods: Single-jaw, Le Fort-based FJTTs were performed on plastic models, one swine and one human, and on a human cadaver. Preoperative planning defined the goal placement of the donor’s Le Fort-based FJTT segment on the recipient. Patient-specific navigated cutting guides helped achieve planned osteotomies. Intraoperative cutting guide and donor fragment placement were compared with postoperative computed tomography (CT) data and the preoperative plan. Results: Intraoperative measurement error with respect to postoperative CT was less than 1.25 mm for both mock transplants and 3.59 mm for the human cadaver scenario. Donor fragment placement (as compared to the planned position) was less accurate for the human model test case (2.91 mm) compared with the swine test (2.25 mm) and human cadaver (2.26 mm). Conclusion: The results indicate the viability of the CAPE system for assisting with Le Fort-based FJTT and demonstrate the potential in human surgery.

PlasticGAN: Holistic generative adversarial network on face plastic and aesthetic surgery,"Chandaliya, Praveen Kumar and Nain, Neeta",2022,Multimedia Tools and Applications,Springer,"Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. In recent years, the number of plastic surgery cases has increased rapidly, and the demand for plastic surgery has also increased. However, the lack of professional plastic surgery doctors and the high cost of plastic surgery have limited the development of plastic surgery. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a holistic generative adversarial network (PlasticGAN) for face plastic and aesthetic surgery. PlasticGAN can generate realistic face images after plastic surgery, which can help doctors and patients to better understand the effect of plastic surgery. Specifically, PlasticGAN consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator is designed to generate face images after plastic surgery, and the discriminator is designed to distinguish between real and generated images. Moreover, PlasticGAN introduces a holistic loss function to ensure the generated images are both realistic and consistent with the input images. Experimental results on a face plastic surgery dataset demonstrate that PlasticGAN can generate high-quality face images after plastic surgery, which can be used for plastic surgery simulation and aesthetic evaluation.",FALSE,

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

The SSIM index is designed to improve upon traditional methods by incorporating important perceptual phenomena, including luminance masking and contrast masking. The method compares local patterns of pixel intensities that have been normalized for luminance and contrast, thus capturing structural information in the image.

Stress wave emission and cavitation bubble dynamics by nanosecond optical breakdown in a tissue phantom,Brujan E.-A.; Vogel A.,2006,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,10.1017/S0022112006000115,"Stress wave emission and cavitation bubble dynamics after optical breakdown in water and a tissue phantom with Nd: YAG laser pulses of 6 ns duration were investigated both experimentally and numerically to obtain a better understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in plasma-mediated laser surgery. Experimental tools were high-speed photography with 50 000 frames s-1, and acoustic measurements. The tissue phantom consisted of a transparent polyacrylamide (PAA) gel, the elastic properties of which can be controlled by modifying the water content. Breakdown in water produced a purely compressive stress wave. By contrast, in stiff PAA samples and for sufficiently large pulse energies, the compression wave was followed by an intense tensile wave, similar to the behaviour previously observed in cornea. The elastic/plastic response of the medium led to a significant decrease of the maximum size of the cavitation bubble and to a shortening of its oscillation period which was found to be related to the generation of the tensile stress wave upon breakdown. For increasing elastic modulus of the PAA, both the amplitudes of the bubble oscillation and of the stress wave emitted during bubble collapse decreased until the bubble oscillation was so strongly damped that no collapse stress wave was emitted. Numerical simulations were performed using a spherical model of bubble dynamics which includes the compressibility and elastic/plastic behaviour of the medium, viscosity, density and surface tension. The calculations revealed that consideration of the elastic/plastic behaviour of the medium surrounding the bubble is essential to describe the experimentally observed bipolar shape of the stress wave emitted upon optical breakdown. Water is a poor tissue model because the shape of the emitted stress waves and the bubble dynamics differ strongly for both materials. The mechanical properties of PAA were also found to be quite different from those of tissues. Experimental and numerical results provided evidence that the dynamic mechanical properties relevant for optical breakdown in PAA and tissue differ by as much as two orders of magnitude from the static values. The discovery of a tensile stress wave after optical breakdown in tissue-like media is of great importance for the assessment of collateral damage in laser surgery because biological tissues are much more susceptible to tensile stress than to compressive stress. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.",TRUE,"Centers on laser-induced stress waves in tissue models, not on predicting or assessing surgical aesthetic results, so it doesn’t fit the review’s focus."

Real-time endovascular guidewire position simulation using shortest path algorithms,Schafer S.; Singh V.; Noël P.B.; Walczak A.M.; Xu J.; Hoffmann K.R.,2009,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,10.1007/s11548-009-0385-z,"Purpose: Treatment of vascular disease often involves endovascular interventions which use the vascular system for delivering treatment devices via a previously inserted guidewire to the diseased site. Previous studies show relative reproducibility of guidewire position after insertion, indicating that the guidewire position is constrained and could be represented by an energy minimization approach. Such representation would support the surgeon's decision process in guidewire selection. Methods: In this paper, we determine the guidewire position using a k-level graph based on 3D vessel information. Guidewire properties are incorporated into the graph as edge weights given by the local bending energy related to the local bending angle. The optimal path through this weighted directed graph is determined using a shortest path algorithm. Volumetric data of two different internal carotid artery phantoms (Ø 3.5-4.6 mm) was acquired. Two guidewires (Ø 0.33 mm) of different material properties (stainless steel, plastic-coated steel core) were inserted into the phantoms. Results: The average RMS distance between actual and simulated guidewire positions varies from 0.9 mm (plastic coated) to 1.3 mm (stainless steel); the computation time to determine the position was <2s. Conclusions: The results indicate that the proposed technique yields reproducible and accurate guidewire positions within a short, clinically relevant time frame. These calculated positions may be useful in facilitating neurovascular interventions. © CARS 2009.",TRUE,"Centers on guidewire simulation for vascular procedures without discussing automated prediction or assessment of cosmetic results in plastic or cancer surgeries, so it doesn’t match the review’s focus."

Reconstruction of 3D human facial images using partial differential equations,Elyan E.; Ugail H.,2007,Journal of Computers,10.4304/jcp.2.8.1-8,"One of the challenging problems in geometric modeling and computer graphics is the construction of realistic human facial geometry. Such geometry are essential for a wide range of applications, such as 3D face recognition, virtual reality applications, facial expression simulation and computer based plastic surgery application. This paper addresses a method for the construction of 3D geometry of human faces based on the use of Elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDE). Here the geometry corresponding to a human face is treated as a set of surface patches, whereby each surface patch is represented using four boundary curves in the 3-space that formulate the appropriate boundary conditions for the chosen PDE. These boundary curves are extracted automatically using 3D data of human faces obtained using a 3D scanner. The solution of the PDE generates a continuous single surface patch describing the geometry of the original scanned data. In this study, through a number of experimental verifications we have shown the efficiency of the PDE based method for 3D facial surface reconstruction using scan data.

Orbital and maxillofacial computer aided surgery: Patient-specific finite element models to predict surgical outcomes,Luboz V.; Chabanas M.; Swider P.; Payan Y.,2005,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1080/10255840500289921,"This paper addresses an important issue raised for the clinical relevance of Computer-Assisted Surgical applications, namely the methodology used to automatically build patient-specific finite element (FE) models of anatomical structures. From this perspective, a method is proposed, based on a technique called the mesh-matching method, followed by a process that corrects mesh irregularities. The meshmatching algorithm generates patient-specific volume meshes from an existing generic model. The mesh regularization process is based on the Jacobian matrix transform related to the FE reference element and the current element. This method for generating patient-specific FE models is first applied to computer-assisted maxillofacial surgery, and more precisely, to the FE elastic modelling of patient facial soft tissues. For each patient, the planned bone osteotomies (mandible, maxilla, chin) are used as boundary conditions to deform the FE face model, in order to predict the aesthetic outcome of the surgery. Seven FE patientspecific models were successfully generated by our method. For one patient, the prediction of the FE model is qualitatively compared with the patient's post-operative appearance, measured from a computer tomography scan. Then, our methodology is applied to computer-assisted orbital surgery. It is, therefore, evaluated for the generation of 11 patient-specific FE poroelastic models of the orbital soft tissues. These models are used to predict the consequences of the surgical decompression of the orbit. More precisely, an average law is extrapolated from the simulations carried out for each patient model.

How to qualify and validate wear simulation devices and methods,Heintze S.D.,2006,Dental Materials,10.1016/j.dental.2006.02.002,"The clinical significance of increased wear can mainly be attributed to impaired aesthetic appearance and/or functional restrictions. Little is known about the systemic effects of swallowed or inhaled worn particles that derive from restorations. As wear measurements in vivo are complicated and time-consuming, wear simulation devices and methods had been developed without, however, systematically looking at the factors that influence important wear parameters. Wear simulation devices shall simulate processes that occur in the oral cavity during mastication, namely force, force profile, contact time, sliding movement, clearance of worn material, etc. Different devices that use different force actuator principles are available. Those with the highest citation frequency in the literature are - in descending order - the Alabama, ACTA, OHSU, Zurich and MTS wear simulators. When following the FDA guidelines on good laboratory practice (GLP) only the expensive MTS wear simulator is a qualified machine to test wear in vitro; the force exerted by the hydraulic actuator is controlled and regulated during all movements of the stylus. All the other simulators lack control and regulation of force development during dynamic loading of the flat specimens. This may be an explanation for the high coefficient of variation of the results in some wear simulators (28-40%) and the poor reproducibility of wear results if dental databases are searched for wear results of specific dental materials (difference of 22-72% for the same material). As most of the machines are not qualifiable, wear methods applying the machine may have a sound concept but cannot be validated. Only with the MTS method have wear parameters and influencing factors been documented and verified. A good compromise with regard to costs, practicability and robustness is the Willytec chewing simulator, which uses weights as force actuator and step motors for vertical and lateral movements. The Ivoclar wear method run on the Willytec machine shows a mean coefficient of variation in vertical wear of 12%. Force measurements have revealed that in the beginning of the stylus/specimen contact phase the force impulse is 3-4 times higher during dynamic loading than during static loading. When correlating material properties to the wear results of 23 composite resins subjected to the Ivoclar method, some parameters could be identified and incorporated into a wear formula to predict wear with the Ivoclar method. A round robin test evaluating the wear of ten dental materials with five wear simulation methods showed that the results were not comparable, as all methods follow different wear testing concepts. All wear methods lack the evidence of their clinical relevance because prospective studies correlating in vitro with long-term in vivo results with identical materials are not available.

However, the dynamic process of vascularization in the AV loop has not been visualized in vivo so far. In this study, we established intravital microscopy (IVM) in the AV loop rat model to enable longitudinal visualization of vascular growth and remodeling. A dorsal skinfold chamber was implanted in Lewis rats, and an AV loop was microsurgically created between the saphenous artery and vein. The AV loop was embedded in a fibrin matrix and placed into the chamber. IVM was performed on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 after surgery using fluorescent dyes to visualize blood plasma and leukocytes. The AV loop remained patent throughout the observation period. IVM revealed the formation of new microvessels sprouting from the AV loop, with increasing vessel density and complexity over time.

FBPFormer: Dynamic convolutional transformer for global-local-contexual facial beauty prediction,"Liu, Qipeng and Lin, Luojun and Shen, Zhifeng and Yu, Yuanlong",2023,,,"Facial beauty prediction (FBP) aims to automatically assess the attractiveness of a given face image, which is a challenging task due to the complex and subjective nature of human perception of beauty. Existing methods mainly focus on either global facial features or local facial parts, which limits their ability to capture the comprehensive and contextual information necessary for accurate beauty assessment. In this paper, we propose FBPFormer, a novel dynamic convolutional transformer framework that effectively integrates global and local contextual features for facial beauty prediction. Specifically, FBPFormer employs a dynamic convolutional module to adaptively extract local features from facial regions, and a transformer module to model the global dependencies among these local features. This design enables the model to capture both fine-grained local details and holistic facial context, leading to improved prediction performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FBPFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach in capturing global-local contextual information for facial beauty prediction.",FALSE,

Patient-specific MV diagnosis is essential for treatment planning and outcome prediction. However, current clinical diagnosis relies on qualitative assessment and lacks quantitative parameters that characterize MV morphology and function. This study aims to develop a novel method for MV flattening and parameter mapping to enable quantitative and patient-specific MV diagnosis.  Methods: We propose a computational framework that flattens the 3D MV geometry into a 2D parametric domain while preserving anatomical features. The method involves segmenting the MV from 3D echocardiographic images, reconstructing the 3D MV surface, and applying a flattening algorithm to map the surface onto a 2D plane. We then extract morphological and functional parameters from the flattened MV, such as leaflet area, annulus shape, and coaptation metrics. The framework is validated on synthetic and clinical datasets.  Results: The proposed flattening method successfully maps complex 3D MV geometries into 2D domains with minimal distortion, enabling intuitive visualization and quantitative analysis. Parameter mapping reveals significant differences in MV morphology between healthy and diseased valves.

A novel incremental simulation of facial changes following orthognathic surgery using FEM with realistic lip sliding effect,"Kim, Daeseung and Kuang, Tianshu and Rodrigues, Yriu L and Gateno, Jaime and Shen, Steve GF and Wang, Xudong and Stein, Kirhyn and Deng, Hannah H and Liebschner, Michael AK and Xia, James J",2021,Medical image analysis,Elsevier,"Orthognathic surgery is a common procedure to correct dentofacial deformities, which results in significant changes in facial appearance. Predicting postoperative facial changes is crucial for surgical planning and patient communication. This paper presents a novel incremental simulation method based on the finite element method (FEM) to predict facial soft tissue changes following orthognathic surgery, incorporating a realistic lip sliding effect. The proposed method models the lip sliding phenomenon by introducing a frictional contact algorithm between the upper and lower lips, which allows for more accurate simulation of lip movements and deformations. The incremental approach updates the simulation step-by-step, capturing the gradual changes in facial tissues during surgery. Experimental results on clinical cases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improved accuracy in predicting postoperative facial appearance, especially in the lip region, compared to existing methods.
